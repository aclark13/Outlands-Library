The town of Terran was officially
established by Prevalian forces
in 348 AC, primarily due to the need
of lumber for the Prevalian navy
under the leadership of Emperor
Laric.

Terran was not founded from
nothing, though. For a great
many years prior, a gypsy
camp existed in the region, which
is still part of the town itself to
this day, along the northern beach.












The gypsies did not keep records
or track their own history save
for oral records, which of course
are not terribly accurate.

However, these oral stories suggest
that the gypsies have been in
the Terran region for about a
hundred years with some stories
suggesting up to two hundred.

For all of these years, the gypsy
camp traded small amounts of
lumber to Cambria and Prevalia
in exchange for food and other
sorts of supplies.









It is worth noting that the Terran
region is known primarily for
its unique lumber. Indeed, a
special sort of pine tree that
grows native only to this region
produces some of the hardest
wood, best used for the
construction of naval vessels.

The quality of lumber is what
made the gypsy camp known
to Emperor Laric when he sent
Admiral Calvarn to the area.













Admiral Calvarn originally intended
to utilize the Terran region as a
depot to resupply his navy. But,
due to the heightened demands for
lumber for a greater Prevalian
navy, the Admiral began encouraging
settlers to travel west. As such,
the town of Terran officially formed
in 348 AC.

The gypsies ultimately folded in with
the Prevalian settlers, becoming
Prevalian citizens over time, though
some members of the gypsy group
preferred to keep with their own
traditions.









The early years of Terran's
establishment were not the
easiest. The surrounding wilds
proved to be treacherous and
dangerous (for the entire
plateau was still full of trees then).

Although protected by Admiral
Calvarn's navy, a number of
settlers perished during their
journeys from Prevalia to Terran.
But, in spite of these setbacks
and losses, Terran ultimately
thrived and greatly enriched
the Prevalian Empire to the point
of having the entire Terran
plateau deforested.








After Emperor Laric passed away
in 441 AC, the 'Reign of the Mad
Emperors' began, which did not
leave Terran unscathed.

Over the course of decades until
the end of Mad Emperor Linus'
reign, Terran was often neglected
with entire supply shipments
withheld, much needed grain
never sent, and new settlers
forbidden from traveling west.

The population of Terran declined
greatly over these 50ish years, much
of the decline is due to starvation.









Following the heels of the starvation
felt throughout the decades of the
Mad Emperors' reign, another
menace reared its head to
threaten Terran (and still continues
to do so to this very day).

Great instability followed the death
of the Mad Emperors, and the
civil wars that followed did
nothing to strengthen Terran.

In fact, Terran found itself with
little to no defense for generations.
The population further dwindled.










In 598 AC, after the return of a
number of tribal monsters to the
Avadonian mainland, the Orcish
fort of Burrz'Uzg was established
not terribly far from Terran.

This new menace of organized
and savage Orc was a great
threat to the diminished people
of Terran. It became a routine
occurrence during 'campaign season'
for Orcs to raid the surrounding
Terran area and carry off
supplies and people which would
be turned into slaves.










In spite of the hunger and raids,
Prevalia eventually re-established
routine supplies to Terran in
more recent years. Armed escorts
occasionally beat back raids by
Orcs and other tribal monsters
of the Outlands.

The stability of Terran grew, and
due to luck or perhaps poor
strategic planning, was never the
target of Cambrian or Andarian
assault, for Prevalia surely would
not have been able to defend the
lumber town.










And thus, today, we find Terran
to be precariously perched
far to the west of a very militarily
diminished Prevalia, which
struggled to keep its own immediate
borders safe and secure.

The people of Terran are strong
and hardy folk, having lived through
times of great peril and danger, but
they are not numerous.
