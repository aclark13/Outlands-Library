Those very first early years after
the cataclysmic events that shaped
Avadon left ruins of an old Britannia
speckled across the lands. From the
ashes of old Trinsic arose a new city.

Cambria sits in the southern reaches
of the mainland, plagued by heat
and drought, at times. Cambria
evolved in this hot and tropical
climate, and its citizens adapted
to the harshness that comes with
unabating sun and too-little potable
water. However, due to the climate,
food was never scarce, and farming
was extremely viable.









During the same years that saw
the conflict between Prevalia
and Andaria begin, Cambria too
ran into conflict with its neighbor
to the north. Prevalia, being the
land and power hungry giant that
it was in those early days, thought
that Cambria would be an easy
target. Indeed, it was... at first.

After a single year of losing every
battle (from 251 AC to 252 AC), a
mutually beneficial opportunity was
realized by the King of Cambria and
the first known mercenary company
formed.









This first mercenary company, which
became known as Condottiere, was
named the Free Company, led by
Captain Lorenzo. For a price, he
fought on behalf of Cambrian
King Artemius. The Free Company
held the gates of Cambria for
nearly a decade. Somewhere
between 267 AC and 275 AC, the
Prevalian King Aron was finally
successful at defeating the Free
Company and conquering Cambria.
Cambria fell under the rule of
Prevalia, becoming a cornerstone
of the Prevalian Empire.











In 315 AC, the noble families of
Corsairand Montague joined the
Prevalian efforts to rid the
Outlands of its tribal menaces. They
were successful in driving out the
gargoyle strongholds that pockmarked the 
deserts.

Similar to Andaria, in the years
between 441 AC and 490 AC, Cambrian
nobility grew increasingly distraught
at thereign of the 'Mad Emperors' of
Prevalia. Nobles began to speak
openly of secession. In the year
491 AC,after the death of Mad Emperor
Linus,Cambria seceeded. They went to
warwith both other Kingdoms the
next year.







The Cambrians did very well as an
independent Kingdom. The strategy
of relying on Condottiere companies
for their main military might proved
to be very effective against both
Prevalia and Andaria. However, the
strategy was costly and by the year
552 AC, the coffers were nearly
empty.

Fortune smiled upon Cambria at
this time, as King Venriel of Cambria
sent out survey teams in search of
new wealth. One such team discovered
a substantial gold vein on Greypeak
Island. This newfound fortunre allowed
Cambria to hire the Dark Banner
Company.







Captain Landau (for he was not
yet married to the Queen of Andaria)
led the Dark Banner Company, which
answered to Lord Falthar of
Cambria, the grandson of King
Artemius and son of King Venriel.

In 558 AC, Lord Falthar led a mighty
Cambrian host, bolstered by Lord
Landau's forces, to Prevalia.
Lord Falthar was successful in
sacking Lower Prevalia, but the
Prevalian navy kept Upper Prevalia
safe. A long siege began at this
time, one that would define the
fate of Cambria for the rest of
time.








The Prevalian King at the time did
attempt to end the siege early with
a single-combat duel between
appointed champions. Lord Falthar
agreed to this. Prevalia chose a
reknown warrior by the name of
Owaen. Lord Falthar chose Landau.

Needless to say, Landau won handily.
The siege lasted until 560 AC. On
a fateful day in that year, Lord Landau
for reasons completely unknown to
any historian, slaughtered Lord Falthar
and dragged his body all the way to
what is now known as Corpse Creek,
where Lord Falthar's bones remain
even now.








Rumors abound in the Cambrian
camp as to why Lord Landau killed
Lord Falthar, and very quickly any
cohesion the Cambrian host had
dissipated without any strong
leaders. Prevalia was able to quickly
lift the siege and smash the
Cambrian forces. Over the course
of the next 40 years or so, Cambria
was unable to do little else except
hold its own shrinking borders
from relentless assaults. In the
year 604 AC, Luka, son of Landau
and Queen Klara of Andaria, began
raiding Cambrian lands.










After two years of constant raids,
the Cambrian army met Luka in a
pivotal battle at Break Pass, which
saw thetotal annihilation of the
Cambrian army.It is said that Luka
made a pact with the Shadowlords,
but that might be mere rumor.

To suffer another cruel blow, at this
time the volcano, known to us as
Inferno, errupted. The resulting tidal
waves destroyed a quarter of
Cambria, which has not recovered
even now. With no army, no money,
and severe damage and poverty within
its own borders, Cambria was ready
for peace.








However, peace would not come.
The Cambrian King joined a fateful
summit to discuss peace with Prevalia
and Andaria, only to disappear with
the other leaders. His son, King
Arshiya, rose to the throne and
remains the ruler of Cambria
today, although inexperienced.

Rebels, bandits, and tribal creatures
have filled much of the former
Cambrian-held lands during this
power gap. Hopefully, King Arshiya
will prove to be a fruitful leader.
