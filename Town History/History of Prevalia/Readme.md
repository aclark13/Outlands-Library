The history of Prevalia is far too
long and varied to adequately do
justice to within the confines
of this single book. Instead, I shall
attempt to touch upon only some
of the more pivotal moments.

Prevalia is not the oldest city, for
that honor goes to both Cambria
and Andaria, but the settlements
that ultimately combined to make
Prevalia do date further back than
either of those Kingdoms. Presumably
around 100 AC, two minor towns
formed in the region we now known
as Prevalia.









One of these settlements sat high
upon white cliffs, and the other sat
below upon canals and marshes.
The two had a symbiotic relationship
offering trade and protection. In
around 155 AC, the two settlements
joined together through bridges to
become the city of Prevalia.

The first Prevalian King hailed from
the noble Fletcher family, crowned
Callum I of Prevalia. He oversaw a
great number of works and city
improvements, some of which can
still be seen to this day.










In 184 AC, King Callum I, along with his
four sons, were killed in an ambush
by orcs in the region known as the
Urukton Bluffs (though this point
is oft disputed). Whatever the true
cause of death, the rule of Prevalia
passed on to his wife, Serphan, and
then to his eldest of his twin sons,
Arryn.

In 210 AC, when he was old enough
to assume the throne, King Arryn
organized a great military campaign
to rid the Outlands of the vile
creatures that plagued it. The King
and his two sons campaigned for years.










King Arryn passed in the year
242 AC. His eldest son, Aron 
assumed the throne of Prevalia.
Like his father, he wanted to push
the military might of Prevalia
further, but instead of fighting the
disparate tribes of Avadon, he eyed
conquests to the north and south: 
Andaria and Cambria.

King Aron had the Prevalian
military engaged with the other
two Kingdoms for a decade before
ultimately conquering Cambria. 
The battle for the subjugation of 
Andaria took longer. In 287 AC,
King Ardis assumed the throne
when his father passed.







In the same year, 287 AC, King Ardis
found success in defeating Andaria,
and combining Prevalia, Cambria, and
Andaria into a singular Prevalian
Empire. As such, King Ardis became
the first Prevalian Emperor.

In 311 AC, Emperor Ardis passed, and
his son Laric ascended the throne.
In tribute to his deceased father, and
all of the Kings that came before him,
Emperor Arids commissioned a great
work that would be named the
Walkway of the Emperor. This
walkway was set in the western
cliffs of Prevalia.









Emperor Laric became known as
'Laric the Industrious' due to his
many great works and defense
fortifications built during his rule.
Indeed, no other Emperor ever
matched the sheer amount of
structures built!

Not being content with the
just building structures, Emperor
Laric wished to build a grand navy.
To do so, he required a great
deal more lumber than he had
access to. And thus, the town of
Terran was settled to fuel this
new navy in 348 AC.









Emperor Laric passed away after
living to the grand old age of 95.
His son, Laric II, was not a notable
ruler and accomplished little of
consequence. He reigned from
248 AC until 441 AC.

Between 441 AC and 490 AC, three
successive Emperors ruled, and
the horrors they inflicted upon the
world are worthy of their own books.
I shall not speak much of them here.
Instead, just know that these three
Emperors, Canack, Reilquios, and
Linus, are surely responisble for
most of the instability in the world.









The Reign of the Mad Emperors took
a heavy political toll on the Realm
at large. Both Cambria and Andaria
split from the Empire, ushering
a new age of civil war and strife.

Upon the death of Emperor Linus, he
left no clear successor to the throne.
Cambria capitalized upon this time
of internal strife and political turmoil
to sack Lower Prevalia. During the
great siege of Prevalia, in the year
558 AC a new King did finally
emerge to lead the defense of the
city, King Calym III, a distant cousin
of Emperor Linus'.









The only event that saved Prevalia
from complete Cambrian destruction
was when Captain Landau killed the
Cambrian Lord Falthar. Only then was
the siege able to be lifted. And only
by the grace of the great Prevalian
navy did Upper Prevalia manage
to hold for as long as it did.

Over the following 10 years, King
Calym III focused all efforts on
rebuilding Lower Prevalia (and indeed
many of the old scars remain). With
a very weakened army, Prevalia could
do little else except stand by when
Andaria came to power.









Up through to around 604 AC,
Prevalia lost hold of most of its
conquered territories. Many of the
outposts and forts built by Laric the
Industrious fell to the likes of
ratmen, orcs, and rebels. To this
day, Prevalia never truly recovered,
and holds only a modest amount of
lands compared to the past.

Prevalia is now lead by King
Laric IV, his father King Alyan having
been slain after a peace summit and
ruling but a day. Enemies encroach
closer upon Prevalia and it is
not clear if this new King can rule
well.
