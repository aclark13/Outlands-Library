I can't speak of Corpse Creek
without also speaking of Lord
Landau, for the two are one in the
same. The blood and sweat of
Lord Landau surely flows through
the creeks just as much as the
blood of the bodies thrown in them.

For most of the Avadonian timeline,
the far northwestern reaches of the
mainland remained frees of the
laws of mankind. Even the great
Avadonian Empire at its height
did not have influence enough
to reach this region. Bandits,
murderers, thieves all called it home.








In 558 AC, the Dark Banner Company,
helmed by Captain Landau, was hired
by Cambria to wage war against
Prevalia. There has never been
a more prestigious and dangerous
company of mercenaries than the
Dark Banner Company.

Under the leadership of the
Cambrian Lord Falthar, the
Dark Banner Company and
Cambrian soldiers successfully
sacked Lower Prevalia and
besieged Upper Prevalia.










In an attempt to end the siege
with as little loss of life as possible,
the Prevalian King challenged
Lord Falthar to a duel between
their two chosen champions.
The Prevalian King chose a warrior
by the name of Owaen. Lord
Falthar chose Captain Landau.

With Captain Landau's victory, the
siege continued until 561 AC when
Captain Landau suddenly turned
against Lord Falthar, killing him
and dragging his body from Prevalia.
Captain Landau led his Dark
Banner Company to the northwest.









Captain Landau took a self-proclaimed
lordship and settled a town that
we now know as Corpse Creek. He
hung Lord Falthar's body for all to
see, and the body remains upon the
bridge to this day. The reason behind
the murder of Lord Falthar remains
a mystery, but due to Lord Falthar
being dragged across the mainland
and splayed in the center of this new
town suggests some level of
vendetta owed by Captain Landau.

Once the Dark Banner Company set
its root down, the area became more
of a haven for criminals and
mercenaries.







In those early days, neither Cambria
nor Prevalia recognized Corpse Creek
as a legitimate town, nor Lord Landau
as a legitimate Lord. Only Queen
Klara of Andaria recognized the
legitimacy of both. It is often said
that she did this as a means to
help broker a relationship
between herself and the now
infamous Lord Landau.

Between 561 AC and 570 AC, Lord
Landau hired out his Dark Banner
Company to whichever of the three
Kingdoms that could pay the most.









In 570 AC, Lord Landau agreed to
meet with Queen Klara of Andaria,
a meeting that would shape the
future of the Andarian Kingdom.
For the following fifteen years,
Lord Landau remained away from
Corpse Creek, instead he married
Queen Klara and took up residence
in Andaria. During this time,
Corpse Creek was very much left
to its own devices. With no
leadership, the town was as
lawless as ever. A black market
soon became established, and
trade with the three Kingdoms
commenced.








After the siege of Andaria in
585 AC, and the loss of his wife,
Queen Klara, Lord Landau forsaken
Andaria and returned to Corpse
Creek.

What Lord Landau did from
between 585 AC and 604 AC is
not known, but after this time
period, Lord Landau simply
disappeared. Although no
official records, there are many
stories and rumors surrounding
the fate of Lord Landau.










One of the more popular tales
of Lord Landau's disappearance
from Corpse Creek states that
he committed suicide, and it is
his blood that turned the creeks
red. Of course, we know this to be
folly, since the creeks have run
red for centuries due to the
red clay found in the mountain
streams that feed into the
creeks. More hushed rumors state
that Lord Landau made a pact with
a Shadowlord, though anybody who
suggests as much always 'heard it'
from a friend of a friend who was
'there' and never heard it themselves.








In 604 AC, Lord Landau's son by
Queen Klara, Luka, abandoned Andaria
in favor of coming to Corpse Creek.
He took his father's helm at the
head of the Dark Banner Company. Over
the course of several years, Luka led
this mercenary group on many
successful raids against the three
Kingdoms, including, much to the
horror of his own people, Andaria.
Luka and the Dark Banner Company
greatly enriched themselves during
this time. In 607 AC, rumors of a
Black Moongate in Corpse Creek
began to circulate.









After this, Luka was seldom spotted
without numerous monsters
swelling the ranks of his army.
Nobody knows for sure what sort
of pact was made between Luka
and whoever was on the other side
of the Black Moongate. To this day
nobody truly knows for sure the
whereabouts of Luka or his
plans. It is deeply suspected that
Luka was behind the disappearances
of the rulers from the Ancient Glade
in 609 AC that brought great
instability to all of Avadon in
modern history.
