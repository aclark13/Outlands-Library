The Kingdom of Andaria is one of the
two eldest Kingdoms in all the lands
of Avadon. Founded approximatley
140 years after the great cataclysm
that shaped our world, early
Andarians built their new town in
the ashes of an old ruined capital
that is known to other lands as
Britain. It is said that the
architectural flourishes of modern
Andaria still reflect the ancient
and ruined stylings of old Britain.

Aside from the founding of Andaria
in those early days, very little was
ever recorded from such early history.









It is oft said that Andarian winters
are among the worst in the known
world. Indeed, Andaria is cold!
During the summer months, a
cool breeze still flows in from
over the western mountains.
During the winters, the cold can
be fatal to the unprepared.

Andaria sits nestled between two
large ice caps, to the east and west.
Due to the abundance of cold
weather, farming seasons are short
and generally not bountiful in
Andaria. Much of the grain and meat
are imported from southern lands.









Around the year 251 AC, the early
Andarians were surprised to find
a previously-unknown southern
neighbor marching an army to
their doorstep. Indeed, up until
this point, Andarians were fairly
isolated in the north, and this
contact with the Prevalian army
was the first real contact with
another nation. Prevalia did not
have its eye set towards peace,
though, and Andaria found itself
quickly on the losing end of a
bloody war.












Indeed, Andaria had no professional
standing army, for their battles
were always against the weather in
previous years. Prevalia, by contrast
had a powerful army comprised of
veteran soldiers.

In spite of this great military
imbalance, in spite of the green
recruits that madeup their forces,
the Andarians became stalwart
defenders of their homes. They
lacked in experience and training,
but had an abundance of conviction
and passion to drive away the
Prevalian invaders. Andaria held
their southern border for ten years.








In spite of holding their southern
borders against a superior foe for
so long, the war of attrition took
a heavy toll, one which Andaria
could not afford to pay indefinitely.

In 287 AC, the Andarians took to
the offensive against Prevalia in a
final effort to dislodge the enemy
at the gates. The Andarian forces
marched south and were ultimately
intercepted at the town of Ardun,
south-west of Lower Prevalia.
The ensuing battle completely
destroyed the town, and decimated
the Andarian forces.









After this pivotal battle in Andarian
history, Andaria capitulated to
Prevalia, becoming a vassal.

In 315 AC, the Andarians were
tasked by the new Prevalian
Emperor with joining a joint effort
to rid the Outlands of the tribal
menaces that infested it. Two
prominent Andarian noble families
were tasked with defeating
Thelmhurst, Lord of the Trolls, and
Utaruk, the King of the Orcs. This
was a matter in which the Andarians
were very successful. This ultimately
ushered in a new age of peace.









In 348 AC, Andaria now recovered
from the wars of its past, began
eyeing expanding its base of
power and influence. An Andarian
survey team set out to the east
and founded the town of Outpost.

This new location would serve to
bolster the military might of Andaria
whilst giving a new trade route to
fill the Andarian coffers.

The years of 441-490 AC, known as
the 'Reign of the Mad Emperors'
spurrned Andaria in the direction
of independence.









To further expand their power and
realize their military ambitions,
Andaria re-settled the ancient city
of Cove, on the western coast of
Avadon. This, combined with
Outpost gave Andaria a military
presence that connected both
coasts of the main continent.
This is generally considered the
height of Andarian supremacy.

In the years 561 AC to 570 AC,
the infamous Lord Landau of the
Dark Banner Company joined their
might with that of the Andarian
Queen Klara's.









Lord Landau and Queen Klara of
Andaria led the Kingdom to the
forefront of power that spanned
for the better part of 15 years.

In 585 AC, Andaria suffered a
tremendous blow in the form of an
Orc invasion from the Spirituality
Bay. During this incredible battle,
Queen Klara was slain, and Lord
Landau, although ultimately
victorious in the battle, left
Andaria in the hands of a governing
Regent (along with his son, the
rightful heir to the throne). The
following years saw the general
decline of Andaria.








When of an age, the heir apparent
Luka, son of Landau and Klara
also left Andaria in favor of helming
his father's old mercenary company.
Instead of ruling Andaria, he raided
it, much to the shock of his subjects.

To this day, Andaria remains under
the rule of a governing Regent,
Regent Cailith. He has spent the
last several years attempting to
delegitimize Luka so that a true
ruler of Andaria can step forward
and lead the nation to greatness
once more.
