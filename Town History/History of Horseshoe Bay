The town of Horseshoe Bay has
rather humble beginnings. Prior to
the year 312 AC, the area where
Horseshoe Bay is now established
was home to a small trading camp
that specialized in the export
of precious gemstones, primarily
to Cambria. However, in 312 AC
a great need for a port of trade
was identified by both Cambria
and Prevalia. As such, Horseshoe
Bay was initially a joint venture
between the two Kingdoms, and
Andaria then joined to make a
third partner in the founding.










Early in its founding, the three
Kingdoms agreed to a joint
rulership over Horseshoe Bay.
Three equal co-rulers were
established, one each representing
one of the major Kingdoms.

Horseshoe Bay quickly grew in
size and importance. Trade flowed
freely in and out of the port town,
and the co-rulership worked well
in keeping a relative peace. This
great influx of trade goods, though
attracted the attention of more
nefarious elements, such as pirates
who gladly helped themselves.









The need for a strong defense
against the increase in pirate and
bandit attacks is what spurred the
decision to construct a holdfast
overlooking Horseshoe Bay and
its surrounding waters. Prevalia,
being the richest of the Kingdoms
by far at this time, was the
primary funding source for this new
construction. This mighty structure
would become known to us as
Aegis Keep.














Prevalia occupied Aegis Keep with a
multitude of soldiers, archers, and
a small portion of its navy. This
military contigent quickly deterred
further piracy from those that sailed
all the way from the Darkmire Isles.

Further, this military presence
thwarted the otherwise growing menace
in the swamplands southeast of
HorseshoeBay. In spite of this strong
Prevalian military presence, the
co-equal leadership of the port town
continued unabated.











When the Prevalian Empire splintered
at the end of the Mad Emperors'
Reign in 490 AC, a great civil war
broke out between the three major 
Kingdoms.

The peace and stability of Horseshoe
Bay was brought into question, seeing
as the co-rulership equally accounted
for all three Kingdoms.

It was ultimately agreed upon by the
co-rulers that they would not
sacrifice the relative peace in order
to take sides in the conflicts.
Horseshoe Bay became too important
of a trading town to do so.







However, as time went on, the
mere importance of the well-situated
trading town did not deter various
political intrigue. On occasion,
one co-ruler or another would
attempt backroom deals to curry
favor with one of the major
Kingdoms, and in more extreme cases,
therewere assassination or poisoning
attempts to remove certain co-rulers
who were seen as rivals.

Perhaps fortunately for Avadon,
these missteps never truly swayed
the township as a whole to break
its neutrality.









While the co-rulers of Horseshoe Bay
maintained neutrality, there were
times when the rulers of the various
Kingdoms would turn their eye of
conquest towards the port town.

No attempts to conquor Horseshoe
Bay have ever occurred, though.
This can be attributed to the wise
counsel given, that the trade town
is far too vital to the sustenance
and well-being of the people of
each Kingdom. To remove Horseshoe
Bay from its position as master trader
would be to starve one's own people.










In 607 AC, it is noted that a
strangePriestess arrived in Horseshoe
Bay, seeking an audience with the
nobility residing within Aegis Keep.

Granted an audience, none of the
townsfolk of Horseshoe Bay ever
laid eyes upon this priestess again.

However, a great many accounts of
strange occurrences have since been
recorded. People disappearing, large
pools of blood being found, strange
runic carvings on the walls. All
contact with Aegis Keep was lost
that year.









Shortly after the silence of Aegis
Keep, young women residing within
Horseshoe Bay began to disappear. It
was ultimatelysuspected that they were
being broughtto Aegis Keep by the
soldiers within. It was only speculation
by the townsfolk as to the purpose of
these kidnappings.

A number of residents of the port
town attempted to investigate these
disappearances. Very few ever
actually returned, and the ones that
did only spoke of blood.











And now, to this day, Horseshoe Bay
remains the primary trade hub of
the three major Kingdoms. And to
this day, Aegis Keep looms silently
over it. The mysteries of the Keep
continue to spur on speculation
and rumors among the townfolk,
though it does not seem that any
answers shall be forthcoming
any time soon.
