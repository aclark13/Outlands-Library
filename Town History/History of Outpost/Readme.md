While Prevalia sought to expand
its power and influence in the
west by establishing Terran, in the
same year of 348 AC Andaria
looked to the east.

With much of the Outlands cleared
of the monstrous tribal presence
at the time, Andaria felt that it
was time to solidify their own
military power, independent of
the Prevalian Empire's.

A group of Andarian surveyors and
settlers set out eastward and found
an island suitable to their needs.









Outpost was established as
a modest-sized keep in a
strategic position north of the
bay of Spirituality, overlooking
the Great Eastern Ocean.

From this vantage point, Outpost
could spot any ships sailing to
and from the Andarian mainland
for miles. In the event of an
invading navy, word could be
relayed to Andaria before it
arrived, which saved Andaria
at least once in its history.











The early population of Outpost
consisted primarily of groups
of merchants and traders, and
the occasional adventurous
spirit, and a small retinue of
soldiers. Due to the location
and the inhospitable weather,
Outpost never became known
as a destination for travelers.

The people who resided within
the fortified walls of Outpost had
a difficult life, one that revolved
primarily around keeping warm
and keeping an ample supply of
food on hand.










During the reign of the Mad
Emperors, between 441 AC and
490 AC, a number of Andarian
citizens, disgruntled with the
Prevalian Emperor, defected
from Outpost and traveled
due west. These people were
discontent with the Andarian
Kingdom as a whole, and sought
to make new lives for themselves
apart from the machinations
of the great Empire and its
subject kingdoms.












This group of dissenters traveled
through the Outpost tunnel
and ultimately found their way
to the valley known to us as
Falkvangyr. The Norsemen living
there were descendants of the
people who once lived in a
kingdom that occupied the area
where Cavernam is now.

The group from Outpost was welcomed
into the folds of the Norseman
town of Falkvangyr. For several
generations, they lived peacefully
together.










On occasion, a military sortie
from Outpost would engage with
the warriors of Falkvangyr
in an attempt to bring the
dissenters to justice on
behalf of Andaria. However,
these military raids were always
met with failure. The Norsemen
were strong and capable warriors
who defended a valley surrounded
by mountains. It was a prime
strategic location to fight
an invader.












Many years went by and the people
of Outpost gave up on their long
gone relatives. In the year 585 AC,
Outpost would get to prove its
crucial importance to the
Andarian empire.

Sailing up through the Bay of
Spirituality, lookouts from Outpost
spotted a massive Orc fleet. These
Orcs were led by a warlord by the
name of Goth Vultog. Outpost
was able to send word to the
Andarian Kingdom, which allowed
for Queen Klara of Andaria to
prepare a proper defense of the city.









While Andaria engaged in a brutal,
bloody battle for its survival
against the invading fleet of Goth
Vultog's, Outpost was able to
send a small fleet of its own to
harry the flanks and rear of the
orc navy. This military action
tied up a number of the orc
vessels, which delayed or outright
prevented reinforcements from
reaching the Andarian mainland
and quite possibly saving the city
itself from total slaughter.












In the wake of the massive invasion
of 585 AC, Outpost was recognized
by the other Kingdoms of the realm
as the important military stronghold
that it was. Neither Cambria
nor Prevalia ever attempted to
wrest controll of it from Andaria.

Andaria itself, reeling from staggering
losses from the invasion (and the loss
of its Queen as well as Lord Landau),
was unable to properly supply
Outpost. As such, Outpost began to
become more independent, seeking
to trade with rival Kingdoms in order
to survive.









Today, although Outpost still lays
under the claim of the Andarian
Empire, there is little Andarian
control over the island itself.
Instead, Outpost mostly governs
itself in Andaria's name, and
trades freely with any Kingdom
or town that is willing. The
people of Outpost know that
their survival hinges upon
open trade, so the politics
of Outpost do not necessarily
reflect that of Andaria itself.
