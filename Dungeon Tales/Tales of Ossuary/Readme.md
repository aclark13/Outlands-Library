For all my life, I searched for where I
belonged. I cobbled, like my father
in Andaria. When I was a woman
grown, I tried my hand at tailoring in
Pravalia. I studied woodworking
in Terran, and the ways of the
blacksmith in Outpost. I never really
belonged to any of those places.
Even in Cambria I felt isolated.
Nobody would stop to talk to me,
nobody was particularly kind. It was
not as if they were purposefully cold
and raffish. They were just...
Self-involved. It wasn't until the big
discovery west of the city that I
would begin to know my place.









It was 468 AC. That was when word
spread throughout Cambria that
giant structures were unearthed
in the desert to the west.

I don't know why, but I knew at
once that I needed to see them.
Some strange, primal cry within
my heart pleaded with me
to go. The Cambrian King put
together a survey team, but I was
not allowed to join. They wanted
soldiers, not women. A
Codottiere was hired for the survey
team. They were willing to take
me on as a craftswoman.









The Codottiere hired by the
Cambrian survey team were called
the Wanderering Band. I've
never heard of them before.
They were no doubt the ones
who would take on the job
for the lowest pay.

My duties were to mend their
clothing, cobble their boots,
mend their mail and polish
their plate. I would see to their
meals and water their horses.

It didn't matter to me what I had to
do. I just needed to go west.










We travelled through the beating
sun and drought-filled desert. The
men of the Codottiere were slaked
with thirst due to exposure. I didn't
mind it though. The further west
we went, the more refreshed I felt.

And then that is when I saw it for
the first time; surrounded by a
small number of uncovered
sandstone ruins that made up
some sort of town, a monumental
spearhead thrusted up from the sand
like a towering god. A place that
the survey team had called
The Ossuary.









I was not allowed to enter the
Ossuary. The survey team insisted
that they be the first inside to see
what was contained within. An
elite guard from the Codottiere
would accompany them for safety.

The longer I waited outside the walls
and chambers of the Ossuary,
the more I felt a pulling in my
heart. What I desired most was
within. I don't know how I knew it,
I just knew it. I could not wait
outside forever. Not when I
was so close to home.










It was three days of silence from
the survey team that went inside.
Their fate was presumed a tragic
one by the Codottiere that
lingered outside. They would
wait for two more days before
packing camp and leaving for
Prevalia, pocketing half of the
gold from Cambria.

They wanted me to go with them.
I told them that I would stay, and
stay I did. I kept vigil for several
days at the entrance. No life
emerged from the Ossuary during
that time. None approached, either.









During those nights, I could see
campfires set up by small bands
of who I can only guess to be
graverobbers at nearby sites
where other, smaller structures
had been unearthed. What
did they hope to find?

I waited until I could wait no longer
and I told myself that it was time
to go home. Into the Ossuary
I went. It was so dark and rather
alarmingly cold in spite of being
in the desert. My eyes adjusted
quickly and I was able to finally
see what laid within.









It was clear that the survey team
did not make it far into the
Ossuary. Their bodies were no more
than perhaps fifty steps within
the front halls. What specifically
happened to them, I could not say,
but nobody outside these rooms
heard a single sound.

As I looked around, I saw tools.
Small, sharp knives, red-stained
bowls, linen older than I couldn't
even guess what. The pungent
aroma of herbs and reagents
hung heavily. When I looked at
the walls, I saw the faces grinning.









The faces were not true faces.
They were faces, once, before the
skin and meat were removed by
time or other causes.

The bleached-white skulls were
happy to see me. I knew them
at once, and they welcomed me
home. I greeted them with a
familiarity that I didn't even have
with my father. They invited me
in with a glance, and further into
the Ossuary I went.

What grand halls! What splendid
architecture! What a marvelous home!









As I walked further and further
inside, I heard someone calling to
me. This voice was melodic and
tantelizing, warm and friendly.

I followed the voice for what felt
like hours, or days, or maybe
only minutes. I found my way into
a huge room with a ceiling so
high I couldn't see the top.
The man there was kind. He said
he was the Speaker of the Dead,
though I don't know what that
means.

He said he was calling me home.
