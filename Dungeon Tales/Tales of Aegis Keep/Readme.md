Dear Alex,

Today I think I fell in love! Oh woe<br>
though that she is a priestess from<br>
the Sisters of Honor cloister.<br>

You should see her. Flaxen hair<br>
that cascades in waves down her<br>
back to her trim waist. Her eyes<br>
are greener than a druid. And oh,<br>
you should see her wonderfully<br>
sculpted bust. I believe it is of<br>
Emperor Reilquios' mother.<br>

I hope this letter finds you well,<br>
-Sir Bannon

My Dearest Alex,

I fear I am not the only one with
eyes for the beautiful priestess
from abroad. Other knights have
certainly taken a keen interest
in her, as has Sir Guinous.

I suspect Sir Guinous has more than
just amorous affection for her,
though. They meet together late
in the evenings, but often with
the Lords of Aegis Keep. I do
wonder what is going on...

-Sir Bannon

Oh Alex,

Please forgive the tardiness of my
latest correspondence! I've
attempted to gain favor of the lady
of Aegis Keep, as the others have
so named the priestess. Alas, my
success has not been forthcoming.

Her attention seems to linger
more on the Lords, as well as
Sir Guinous, than the likes of the
lesser knights. I do not know what
I should do. If you have advice, I
am certainly open to hearing it!
-Sir Bannon

Dear Alex,

What am I to do? My heart bursts
for this maiden! I've never felt such
an overflow of feelings for someone,
and to think, she hasn't even deigned
to present me her name! Oh how
I envy Sir Guinous, who spends
almost every evening with her.
It does not matter to me that
she pays him more notice. If I
challenge him, she will see how
devoted my heart is to her. Truly
my love is stronger than his sword.

-Sir Bannon

Alex,

Forgive the messy handwriting of
this letter. Sir Guinous took my
dominant hand during my challenge.
I suppose I am lucky that he heeded
the wise words of the priestess,
who told him to spare me. But...
I have lost her to him.

Though I think she still favors me
at least a little, for she kept my
hand! Surely she means to keep it as
a token of my affection. What else
would she want it for?
-Sir Bannon the Lefty

Dear Alex,

I've not been the only one to
challenge Sir Guinous, it seems.
A half dozen challenges came to him
this week alone. The priestess did
not ask for their lives to spared. I
suppose I was very lucky.

She did request their bodies be
brought to her private chambers.

The Lords of Aegis Keep have been
spending far more time with the
priestess than their duties.
-Sir Bannon the Lefty

Alex,

Something is amiss, I suspect. My
dearest priestess has opened the
gates to a group claiming to be from
the Sisters of Honor, though they
do not look like pious folk. They
did, however, bring some bound
maidens with them. Supposedly
they were from Andaria.

This strange group brought the
maidens to the priestess in her
chambers. A week passed since,
and they've not been seen.

Alex!

A fight broke out in the barracks
yesterday. I heard a curdling yell
whilst I tended my mount in the
stable. When I went to investigate,
I witnessed a group of men plunging
daggers into Sir Galvin. He was
dead before anyone could
intervene. The soldiers each then
professed their unyielding love
for the High Priestess, named so
by her growing retinue which now
includes all the Lords as well as
Sir Guinous. I know not what to do.
-Sir Bannon the Lefty

Oh Alex, my Dearest Alex...

How could I have felt such strong
love for this priestess? Whatever
glamor that had befallen me seems
lifted, the more I witness the horrors
committed by the soldiers of Aegis
Keep. Murder has become more than
commonplace, and all-too-frequent
sojourns to Horseshoe Bay has
resulted in numerous kidnappings
of the local maidens, all of which
are brought to the High Priestess.
Whispers of dark acts echo through
the halls at all hours.
-Sir Bannon the Lefty

Alex...

The men have gone mad for their
High Priestess. Why I have not
turned, I could not guess. In spite
of well-stocked food stores, they
feast on bodies and drink blood.

Sanguinous (which is how is now
named), has underwent some sort
of... transformation. I will attempt
to flee this wretched place tonight.
If you do not hear from me again,
assume that I was caught trying
to escape. Be well, Alex...
