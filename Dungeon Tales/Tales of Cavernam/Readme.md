Beholden to no King or Sovereign,
the hardy knights and soldiers of
the northern regions were seldom
trifled with by the early Andarians;
It is perhaps more accurate to say
the early folk who would eventually
settle Andaria, some time in the
future.

The northmen, often referred to
as the norsemen, kept the very
far northern reaches clear of the
tribal orcs and lizardmen that
plagued so much of the Avadonian
mainland. These norsemen were
truly formidable warriors.









The rites and rituals of these early
norsemen are not clearly known
to us. Their traditions were passed
orally from generation to generation,
and nothing was written down.
Much is the pity, because of what
ultimately happened to these
people, a great deal of their culture
influence were erased from the
pages of history.

But, still, some stories do still
exist. What credence we can
give to them, nobody can say
for sure, but alas, it is all that
remains of the old bloodlines.









It is said that before the founding
of even Prevalia, the norsemen
built a massive fortress in the
far northern region of the mainland.
Their warrior culture dominated
all aspects of their society, and
it is said that the mightiest of the
norseman champions infused a
sword with all of his might and
plunged it into a stone at the
heart of the fortress, so that
all norsemen can draw upon its
strength. It is also said that no
unworthy person could ever
remove this sword from its stone.











Indeed, there is a sword stuck in
a rock deep within Cavernam. And
indeed many have tried to unsheath it,
but is there any real truth to the
legends of its ability to infuse the
norsemen with great strength?

If we look due west of Cavernam, or
due south to Falkvangyr, we can still
find norsemen living in these areas,
long descendants from the ancient
norsemen. They still believe in the
legend of the sword (and indeed, it
is guarded by a spectral champion)
and say that they draw power from.
it. Who are we to argue?









But what did happen to that great
norsemen fortress all those centuries
past? The norsefolk stories give wildly
different accounts. Some suggest that
a great ice god grew jealous of their
strength and coated the region in
rime and frost. Others say that an
ice witch cursed the land and the
rocks and ice grew around the
fortress to trap everyone inside.

Most likely the norsemen were the
subjects to the great cataclysmic
forces that shaped the rest of Avadon
and its peoples. That is to say,
nature claimed the fortress Cavernam.









There is ample evidence that
the lands upon which Cavernam
resides were not always frozen.
Should you visit the sword in the
stone upon the lake, you will see
deep down at the bottom of the
frozen water, a boat. Should you
look around further, you will notice
both frozen and unfrozen streams
and rivers throughout the old
fortress. No doubt the norsemen
once drew upon these watersources
for the sustenance of their own
society. It is possible they were
even agricultural in the early days.










So how exactly did this fortress,
which was then claimed by ice and
snow, become infested with all
manner of horrors and then
become sealed off? Most
norseman stories (notably the
epic poem 'Baelorn Frost') agree
that it was the later generations of
norsemen who sealed off Cavernam.
It is believed that since the ice took
the great fortress, it became a
central place for nefarious forces
to gather. The norsemen, although
war-like and tribal, were and remain
currently highly superstitious.










The rime knights and soldiers that
wander the ancient halls of the
mighty fortress are believed to be
norsemen from the days of yore.
So the modern norsemen say.

Their spirits wander the halls and
protect Cavernam from intruders.
You will find the strongest of
them guarding their legendary
sword.

Since the Cavernam expedition
unsealed this place, the norsemen
believe that the spirits of their
ancestors are angry at the intrustions.









It is of note that the olden norsemen
had an affinity for taming dragons.
It would seem that these were perhaps
the very same dragons brought about
by the Knights who settled
Nursero in the very early times.
Evidence can still be seen to this
day of this affinity, as there are
statues of dragons still lingering
within the halls of Cavernam.

More telling is the presence of an
ancient and wholly terrifying ice
dragon. There are no stories from
the norsemen about this creature,
though.









The norsemen of legend were
certainly extremely talented
builders to craft such a wonderous
fortress. Only a modicum of that
talent passed through the centuries
to the Falkvangyr norsemen.

It is possible that the early
architectural designs were taught
to the norsemen by the Knights of
Nusero in some sort of trade
or agreement. There is simply no
way of knowing for sure.
