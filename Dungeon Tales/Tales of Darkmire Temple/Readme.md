Oh, lost to age and knowledge is
the true purpose of Darkmire Temple.

In spite of what most plainfolk
think, the term 'Darkmire' applies
to the entire chain of islands in
the southeastern hemisphere.
The Darkmire Temple is what
most folk mean when they mention
as such.

This Temple is older than written
history, serving a purpose that can
only be speculated at. The horrors
found within are best left
undisturbed by the likes of man.









Any ardent explorer of the various
Darkmire Isles will note that there
are a number of disparate tribes
scattered throughout. It would
seem that these various tribes
have a common ancestry
to the once great and now unknown
tribe that build Darkmire Temple.

And indeed, should an explorer
delve into the Temple, they will
find the old children of this
long-gone tribe, lurking within
the halls for reasons unknown.











There are several key observations
to be made of the Darkmire Temple.

Firstly, it is extremely old. It
perhaps predates even the cataclysm
that formed Avadon into what it
is today.

Secondly, it is the focal point of
a great deal of magical power. It is
not hard to find abundance evidence
of this within the creatures that
inhabit the area.

Thirdly, It was build with a purpose.
Who would build here otherwise?










Due to the pre-cataclysmic age of
the Temple, its location on a focal
point of immense magical power, and
the fact that the location it was built
was quite intentional suggests that
the tribe that dwelled here
sought out this great power, perhaps
they were even drawn to it.

Those few who are familiar with
ancient Britannian history
(that is to say, pre-Avadonian times)
will be able to draw a similar
conclusion to what I have.
The Darkmire Temple rests atop two
very old, very powerful locations...









The first being the ancient dungeon
of Hythloth. Indeed, the Darkmire
Islands, when looked at closely
on a map, resemble portions of
Fire Isle of Britannia. No doubt
the rest of the island is sunk
beneath the sea.

The great evils within the old
Hythloth perhaps could have
drawn the ancient tribe to this
place, but I think not.
There is an even greater power that
has always lurked further beneath
even Hytloth, and is even older.
The Great Stygian Abyss.









For those needing a refresher in
ancient Britannian history, the
Isle of Fire (known at the time as
the Isle of the Avatar) emerged
from the sea following the Third
Age of Darkness, at the beginning
of the Age of Enlightenment and
the founding of the Virtues.

To gain access to the Great
Stygian Abyss, the Book of Truth,
Bell of Courage, and Candle of Love
were required to open the seal.

But what if there was no Avatar
of the past to open it?









And thus we come to the crux
of my speculation. In alternate
histories, the Avatar lived and
plummeted into the depths of this
Stygian Abyss and retrieved the
Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.

However, we know in Avadonian
history that the Avatar perished...
The Codex still remains locked
away deep within the Abyss!

I suspect it is this great and powerful
artifact that drew the early tribe
here. They perhaps did not truly
understand why.









What does any primal, indiginous
group of people do when in the
presence of a power far greater
than them and simply cannot be
comprehended? They build
a shrine to it, and they worship it.

The Darkmire Temple is then
perhaps one of the oldest known
structures, built by an ancient
tribal civilization who worshipped
the power of the Codex of
Ultimate Wisdom, without even
knowning what it was.











Of course, over the many centuries
since, the purpose of the Darkmire
Temple was lost, as the written word
had not yet emerged in Avadon.

There are no indications as to
whether or not this ancient tribe
ever succeeded in delving deep
enough to discover the Great Stygian
Abyss, much less the Codex.

Perhaps mere veneration of this
great power was enough for this
early tribe. Maybe, over time, the
younger generations forgot why
they were there in the first place.









And naturally over the course
of these same hundreds of years,
other creatures were attracted
to the magical summons from
deep below. The now ancient
and sentient trees rooted themselves
as saplings in the young soil,
soaking up magic like so much
rain water. The fae creatures
also most likely were attracted
by this same power, for it is
not an inherently evil one.

Somewhere, deep below the
Darkmire Temple likes Hytloth, and
beneath that, the Great Stygian
Abyss.
