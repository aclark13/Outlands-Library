It has no eyes to see.
It has no nose to smell.
It has no hands to feel.
It has no ears to hear.
Yet it wants to learn.

It knows darkness, for it has no eyes.
It knows nothing of how air tastes.
It knows only cold and wetness.
It knows only garbled sounds.
Yet it wants to learn.

So it sends me.
It knows what must come after.
It knows to have an after...
something must come before.









It reaches out with my hands.
I touch the rocks, it now knows
the texture and weight of rock.
It knows it is heavy enough to
crush something.

It listens with my ears.
I hear the sounds of flowing water
and it now knows about waterfalls.

It is curious and it learns fast.
I touch everything.
I listen to everything.
I sniff everything.
For each time I do...
It learns.









I am its eyes and through me
it gazes upon soft, fleshy creatures
for the first time.

It does not know what these are.

Through me it learns that these
flesh creatures are not strong.
Through me it learns that the flesh
is easy to cut with metal.
Through me it learns that the flesh
is easy to crush with stone.
Through me it learns that the flesh
ceases to live when underwater.

It wishes to learn more.










It begins to see blue and white swirls.
It begins to smell copper.
It begins to feel earth and stone.
It begins to hear screams.
It wants to learn more.

It enjoys the screams, the long
undulating wails of the flesh.
It particularly enjoys pulling
the flesh from the calcium rods
that lie inside.

Of course, it does not do this itself.
It does it through me.
It wants me to do more.
It must keep growing.









It understands certain things now.
It knows what water is.
It knows this because it is entirely
surrounded by it.

It knows that the flesh is known
by the name 'human'.
For it has heard, through me,
them calling each other that.

It understands that it has a purpose.
It does not fully understand
what that purpose is.

It knows that my purpose...
Is to serve it.









I read the tomes of humans
so that it knows what I know.
The more it learns, the more
it hungers for more tomes,
for more knowledge.

It always knew what must come
after. It had a mother and father,
afterall.
They are gone, though, but it
remembers them.

Since it knows what must come
after, it knows what must come
before.
The Precursor.









It reaches out through me.
It learns the anatomy of the human.
It learned this through many
observations of dissections.

It learns of magic.
It learned this through countless
years of reading tomes.

It learns of anger and revenge.
It learned this through the loss
of its mother and father.
The ones the humans have named
Mondain and Minax.

It learns of patience and planning.









It does not know how old it is.
It does not know how long it slept.
It knows that I serve it, though.
And that is enough for it. For now.

It continues to learn much.

It learned the sight of fire.
It learned the feel of grass.
It learned the smell of sulfur.
It learned the taste of blood.

It learns rapidly
for there are many precursors
who come before what must
come after.









The humans built a structure atop
where it sleeps, though far above.
A 'dam' they name it.
It learns about dams and structures.
It learns that human flesh is easy
to peel from the calcium rods when
submerged for long periods of time
in water.

With this structure, it understands
that it has an opportunity.

It wills the precursors to take the
structure from the humans. From
here on, we are to bring humans
here, so that it can learn.









It knows of dragons, for it has
drowned them.
It knows of daemons, for it has
conjured them.
It knows of its purpose.
It knows it must remove the humans
from this land, which belongs to it.

It knows what came before.
Now, it is ready for what must
come next...

The Exodus.
