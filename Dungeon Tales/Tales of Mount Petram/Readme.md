The roots are deep here, they
stretch from the surface all the way
down to where it is too hot to go.
One does not need eyes to know
that this is a beautiful and
wonderous place.

The earth lives here. She is as alive
as I am. She is old. She is older
than memory.

But why am I here? Why did She
summon me so? I ask the earth
and She just tells me but riddles.

-Mog Roith









Marvelous gemstones came to
life today - O' citrine and
amethyst, diamond and ruby!
Dance, dance like the wind!

The earth sent to me these
wonderful companions. She knows
that I miss my daughter and
that this place is not my own.
They don't speak, but they do
hold wisdom as old as the dirt
itself, and no amount of asking
will loosen this knowledge from
their lips.

-Mog Roith









I found myself wandering this day
and perhaps each day for the
past hundred days, or thousand, or
maybe even a thousand thousands.
Deeper and deeper she led
me through the tunnels. O' this
wonderous earth!

What is it that she wishes for me
to see down here?

I ask her, but She is as mute as
ever She was. She is not my earth,
but She is yet the same.

-Mog Roith










This day I took a break and sat
upon the rocks that overlook the
flowing rivers beneath the earth.

She did sense that I was lonely, as
my gemstone friends were left
behind. And so, she made a
beautiful garden right there under
so much earth!

Grass, flowers, lichens, and moss!
They all came alive to become
friends with me as the gemstones
did once before.

-Mog Roith









I was tempted greatly to stay in the
vast garden that She made for me.
The bark and moss giants tell the
greatest stories, even though they
are too young to know much.

But O' sweet earth, She beckons
me on! So with a sad heart I say
farewell to the gentle giants and
continue on the path I followed
countless days prior.

She still does not tell me what She
wants me to see.

-Mog Roith









This day I came to the end of the
known paths. Before me all that
existed was stone and boulder.

And yet, she urges me onward. And
so, I dig. I dig for a day, for ten
days, for a hundred days. And then
I do it again, and again. I dig until
my hands grow as hard as the
rocks. My arms become the trunks
of trees, and my body is encased
in the thickest bark. And still
I dig, ever onward, ever downward.
She calls to me still.

-Mog Roith









And so after a thousand thousand
days, She tells me to stop digging.
I am where She wants me to be.

But where am I? What is this?
A gemstone lies at my feet.
It is red - a ruby, perhaps? But
it does not feel like a ruby. She
tells me that it is not like a ruby.

Then what is it?
Is it death? Is it life?
Is it something more?
She is silent.

-Mog Roith









At last She whispers to me the
nature of this gem, so glittering
like the sun! She needs me to
hide it, for it is both life and
death and so much more, it is
existence itself, and its opposite.

Within the gem, upon a closer look
entire worlds in every facet
reflect back at me. I watch
as civilizations rise and fall
and entire peoples exist and
then stop. At once I know that
this gem needs to be hidden.

-Mog Roith









I ask sweet earth if I should destroy
the gem. She tells me that even She
does not have the power to do that.

Where did it come from, I ask her.
She does not know.

Did somebody make it?
She does not know.

Where should I hide it? For a moment
She is silent. She then tells me to
hide it where even She can't see.
And so I shall.

-Mog Roith









The earth asks of me to never tell
anyone or anything where I hid
this ruby gemstone. I promise
her that I wouldn't. She is happy.

With the task finished, She bids
me the most fond of farewells.
The gemstone men and the
kindly moss and bark giants
come to see me off as well. I shall
miss them all dearly. But, it is time
to return to my home, to my
daughter.


-Mog Roith
