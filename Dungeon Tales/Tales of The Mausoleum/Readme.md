I met up with Lam today in the
Cottiere Kings tavern today. He
wanted to know if I was still looking
to learn about certain kinds of magic.

Well, duh. Of course I was! But with
hostility between Andaria and
Cambria right now, I couldn't
travel there, and Prevalia was out
of the question (where's your stinkin'
empire now?) So when Lam said
he met some folk involved in arcane
knowledge, I agreed that I would go
and meet with them the next time Lam
meets up with them.
I hope it won't be a waste of time.

The arcanists we met today were...
in a word, strange. They were
beyond pale in complexion, and
several of the queiter ones (I do
not think I heard them speak once)
had long scars around their faces
and necks. But... It was fruitful!

The Lord of Yellow, as the leader
was called apparently, said that
if I were to study under him, I
would learn the nuances between
life and death. I am not sure
that is quite what I had in mind.

I just wanted to learn Energy Bolt.


---






Apparently the Lord of Yellow, and
Lam for that matter, do not take no
for an answer! Lam nearly
threatened violence to get me to
meet with the arcanists today.

We met inside a sepulchre of
some sort. A large crypt filled with
the bodies of who-knows-who.

We all (a good twenty or thirty of
us) gathered down by an Ankh. Maybe
they were more virtuous than I
had initially given them credit for?

And then I saw the blood.



---






The Ankh at the gathering was
smeared in the blood taken from
one of the desecrated corpses from
the great crypt. What kind of magic
involves this? I've never heard of
such a thing.

I would have left, but strange men
with red hallow skin stood by the
doors. They had weapons. I did not
want to chance anything. I would
sit quietly, observe, and leave.
I would never come back.

But what the Lord of Yellow showed
us...I can't ever unsee.



---





I told myself once I was out of that
crazed Mausoleum, I would not
return. But today I found myself
wandering back on my own accord.

What fel magic has twisted my
mind to do such a thing?

I was told to start cutting open the
bodies laid out on tablets. I was
to remove intestines and weight
them. Apparently you can find
diseased bowels just by the weight,
even if they are old and rotten.

I was told to keep the diseased ones.





---




Today, I severed a leg from a corpse.
I never thought I would desecrate
the dead, but... It was educational.
I was able to properly identify
every vessel, every rotten artery,
every strata of bone.

I then successfully attached it to
a different cadavre. I was shown
the secret to making this succesful,
to making this body able to
walk upon this new leg.

The Lord of Yellow seems very
pleased with the progress I am
making so far.





---



There exist a great many tomes of
knowledge within this large
Mausoleum. I can't read many of
them, for they are in some strange
language that only the Lord of
Yellow and his top aids can fathom.

It was explained to me that these
books were forbidden. They were
once locked away deep within the
Lycaeum, only to be liberated when
it fell to attack. The Lord of
Yellow took great interest in
tracking the tomes down and
bringing them here. He is showing
me how to read them.





---



I was invited deeper down into the
Mausoleum today. I've never been
allowed to travel this far. I guess
I am proving that I can handle what
is asked of me and not divulge
the secrets of what I see to any
outsiders.

The work of the higher acolytes
were things of beauty and terror.
Flesh cobbled together, moulded
like a sculptor sculpts stone. These
strange and terrible creatures
guard something that lies further
within the Mausoleum. I have not
proven myself ready for that, yet.





---



A Cambrian survey party came to
the Mausoleum today. What they
sought, I couldn't say. But it was
clear to me that if they discovered
our secrets here, they would lead
soldiers here and kill us.
There is no way that they would
be able to understand the vital
importance of what goes on here.

So I had to kill them.

This was the first time that I've
been able to practice on fresh
bodies. They are more difficult
to cut into pieces than rotten ones.



---





Today I was told I could go down
below, into the deepest bowels of
this crypt and finally see what it
is that we are working towards.

The Lord of Yellow guided me
down through unknown passages
to a great library. The tomes there
were beyond my comprehension.

And then I saw it. The Lord of
Yellow showed me a hole in the
floor, and that floor led to...

I can't describe it. It is beautiful.
And he will show it to you, too.
