Have ye, brave adventurer, ever
puzzled at the strange mountain
southeast of Cambria that is Inferno?

What would you think if I told you
that the mountain isn't very old
at all? It only erupted in 608 AC!

But the 'when' is of no importance.
It is the 'why' that matters.

So, then, why did this volcano
erupt in a space that once contained
absolutely no mountain or volcano
at all? The story, you see, starts
with a skull.









That is a bit misleading, for the
skull actually does not enter into
the tale until later. The story truly
starts, as any good one does, with
a tragedy.

You see, a man by the name of Jude
lost his dear wife. He loved her
more than anyone could love
anyone. She was everything
to him, and she was taken
from him by the Red Dance
(a most horrific end to say the
least).

And so, with the burden of loss heavy
upon him, he began his search.








What was he searching for, you
ask, brave adventurer? Why, for
anything that might bring back
his beloved! Wouldn't you?
He asked every scholar, every
learned mage, every scribe that
he could find. None knew of a
way to bring her back to him, for
even the Resurrection spell would
not return one taken by the Red
Dance.

It was not until he spoke with a man
named Lam did ol' Jude learn of
an artifact that could restore his
love to him.










This artifact, you see, was the skull
that was so mentioned several pages
back. But this was no ordinary skull,
of course. What sense would that
make? No, this was the skull of a
wizard. BUT! This was no mere
wizard's noggin we're talking about.
Ohhh no. This skull belonged to none
other than the infamous Mondain.

You see, it was some sort of hidden
or forbidden knowledge that the
ancient bones of Mondain held great
and terrible powers. And as chance
would have it, this Lam fella seemed
to know an awful lot about that skull.









The secrets of the Skull of Mondain
seem to be a locked secret among
those cultists who reside deep within
the Mausoleum and their infernal
library. But Lam seemed to pass
on enough information to Jude, and
ol' Jude got it into his own skull that
he would find Mondain's noggin
and use it to restore the love of
his life back to her former glory.

And so Jude commissioned a ship
from a notorious pirate from the
Cambrian region. With knowledge
from Lam, a sextant, and a map,
Jude went to find that skull.









Lo' and behold, did Jude find this
magic wizard skull? You would
think so by the way this story
is told. But alas, I simply do not
know whether or not he did.
What comes beyond this point
is all mere speculation and bits
and bobs of tales and rumors.

What is known is that our friend
Jude did find *something*.
What that something is, who knows.

What happened after he found this
object is written as clear as day
across all books of modern history.









You see, upon discovery of the skull
or mystery object, a greak shake
siezed the Great Eastern ocean, with
the epicenter not-so-coincidentally
being right where the object was
retrieved. The pirate captain did
not linger and set sail immediately.

A violent, cataclysmic explosion
erupted from the ocean. Steam,
fire, smoke, molten rock spewed
upwards through the sky and rained
down for miles around. The
tidal wave from this violence
drowned an entire section of
Cambria forevermore.









Although a large swath of Cambria
was destroyed, ol' Jude survived.
The guilt of his unintended mass
murder would weight heavily
upon him for the duration of his
life (which did not last the return
trip with the pirate captain).

The legacy of what he unleashed
endures today, and perhaps for
all days to come: the raging,
fiery mass of a mountain that we
now know and love as Inferno.












Over the following years, mages and
scholars from 'round the world studied
Inferno and have come to a conlcusion.
They do not know what made this
place, nor do they understand
why there is such a powerfully evil
magic within. No doubt, it is
residual from whatever Jude
unleashed with the artifact that
mysteryiously disappeared along
with the pirate captain afterwards.

But this heinous magic has drawn in
all manner of infernal creatures and
elemental fire. Virtues be good,
look at the lava-spewing daemons!









And so the story goes. There is no
happy ending to this one, for
Inferno rages even today. The
monsters that dwell within seem
to have settled in for the long
haul. To me, the real mystery is
where is the pirate captain?
Did he abscond with the artifact?
Did he hide it? Did it kill him?
Possess him? We know that much
of his crew lived to tell the tales,
but what about HIM?

I guess we will never truly know.
