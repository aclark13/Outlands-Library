The chief architect of the project
has ordered us to carry out our duty
regardless of the situation...

Nobody knows where we are still
or how we even got to this strange
island, but it doesn't matter right
now. We have our orders.

The earth here seems tilled and the
entire face of the land seems to be
scarred and moved. Something had
happened here not long ago,
something cataclysmic...

Construction begins tomorrow...



---





Progress is moving along well at
the construction site. A quarry has
been setup in the nearby mountain.
The castle's first stone is placed...

But still, we are stranded here now
and not sure where we are as the
maps we have do not show this
island or volcano to even exist!

Knights are not ship builders but
stone masons and carpenters. We
have enough resources available to
survive and carry out our orders...

Maybe this is the right island...




---




The castle is well on it's way to
completion and we've begun
excavating deeper below to expand
the reach of this fortress under the
earth. Our surveyors believe it to
be a safe place should the nearby
volcano erupt and our knights need
to take cover... Virtues bless us.

Outside of the castle's construction
site other knights have taken up the
task of teaching themselves how to
build ships by trial and error. We
need to find out where we are...

We must inform the Commander...





---




The castle is complete and a glorious
statue of a knight has been placed in
the courtyard to commemorate our
order. Construction below the castle,
however, seems unending. Endless
amounts of stone are transported to
the castle from the quarry as more
catacombs stretch deeper, expanding
the castle's dungeon evermore.

Our knights have nearly mastered the
art of ship building and will soon set
sail to find the mainland and inform
the Commander of our status...

Virtues bless them... Avium...



---





It has been weeks since our knights
have set sail to seek mainland and
inform the Commander of both this
strange island not located on any
map and our progress while
marooned on this lush rock.

In other efforts, magic has been a
recent study to use crystals as a
form of communication with the mage
councils back on mainland. Progress
has only begun in this regard, but I
do hope it works, as we watch the
horizon daily for ships to return...

I pray they return with good news...




---



Finally the ships returned, but lo, it
was with grave news. It appears we
are not in the realm of Sosaria any
longer but now in a place called
Avadon... We have no choice but
to settle...

More ships were built and more
knights set out to learn as much as
they could about this world. Others
set out to find proper guardians of
this great castle and it's catacombs.
The rest of us begin to farm the
land and some sail to settle on
mainland.

We must inform the Commander...



---





Months of attempting to contact
the mage councils of Sosaria via the
communication crystals seems to
grow more futile every day. Some
strange magic over this realm seems
to be blocking our efforts...

But lo, ships return with information
and mighty dragons tamed by the
bravest of our knights to guard our
castle walls and dungeon depths.

We have learned to grow crops and
families as well...

This is our home now...




---




One of the excavators in the castle
catacombs have unearthed a strange
stone that seems to hold a magic
energy within it. Our knights tried
to use it to contact our home world
but I fear instead they contacted
someone, or something else...

We should be careful of such
things when we know so little of
this world and its magic. There are
strange tales our knights share from
the mainland and a shattered
history that they stem from...

Who knows who might be listening..




---




Something is wrong.. Our officers
grow more interested in the power
of the dragons that were brought
here to guard this massive castle.
They have begun practicing strange
magic with the dragons and do not
come out of the catacombs for days.

Our men grow worried as our
superiors do not seem themselves
and pay little attention to the daily
disciplines of knighthood and
Virtuism.. It all began when we tried
to contact our home with that shard...

Who did we really contact?..




---




It's too late.. the dragons that were
to guard this castle have turned on
us. Those who survived the horrific
sight have fled from the island to
the mainland. There is no choice for
the rest of us trapped below the
castle between salvation and
death within the dragons maw.

Damn the evil that was released
when we found that strange stone
shard below the castle... May the
Virtues forgive us for whatever we
have released. This is our last stand.

For Nusero Castle!!.. Huzzah!
