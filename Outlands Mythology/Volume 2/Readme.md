Between the years of 441 AC and
449 AC reigned the first of the
'Mad Emperors', Emperor Canack.

From generations of close familial
relations and the defilement of
the Virtues, a most heinous curse
was passed to this Emperor and the
successive two that followed. No
doubt this curse was a punishment
for all the people of Avadon who
allowed such close mixing of
families for so long. Indeed,
a great deal of the modern
instability we all know stems
from these Mad Emperors.









What marked Emperor Canack's
relatively short-lived rule was his
love for torture. It was never
enough to merely torture his
own enemies. To Emperor
Canack, torture was not something
to inflict on a spy to gain
information, or as a punishment
to inflict upon the wicked.
Torture, for this Emperor, was
a leisure activity. He was so
consumed with this hobby that
he earned himself the moniker
Emperor Canack the Questioner.











As a younger child, it was noted
by the Steward to Emperor
Laric II (Canack's father) that he
had a proclivity for pulling
the legs off of spiders. This
was first thought of as a mere
phase of boyhood, but it was
rumored that the child was simply
consumed with pulling the legs
off of not just spiders, but any
insect he could get his hands on.

Over the years, this behavior
evolved, as a Prevalian farmer
caught a young adolescent Canack
slicing tails off of live cattle.










Emperor Laric II, not being of strong
mental constition, sent his young
son, Canack, to learn of warfare
with one of his generals, no doubt
thinking that turning his cruel
ambitions towards the nefarious
monsters of the Outlands would
ultimately set the boy right.

Instead, this short foray into the
world of swords and sharp objects
taugh young Canack a great deal
about the use of pointed things
and where to stick them to
maximize the amount of pain.










Stories and rumors abound upon
Canack's return to court of him
impaling Prevalian soldiers who
were said to have made infractions.
Other rumors stated that he used
a carpenter's saw to behead a local
village girl. Whatever the truth
of the matter is, most of the
Nobility of Prevalia were wary.

And so it was a telling day when
Emperor Laric II passed, and the
throne went to the now of-age
Emperor Canack. The first order
he gave was to have a boy sent to
his chambers. The boy never returned.









Paranoia set in early on in the
reign of Emperor Canack. Diplomats
from Andaria and Cambria soon
stopped visiting Prevalia when
their precursors never returned
and tales widely circulated of
Emperor Canack having their
intestines removed for imagined
treacheries and slights.

Unfortunately, this paranoia also
claimed Emperor Canack's first
wife, whom he suspected of
plotting against him (though there
was never any evidence of such).










As the first years went on, Emperor
Canack turned towards kidnapping
Prevalian nobles and torturing
them, sometimes keeping them
alive for days while he had
insects slowly eat their skin.
The reason for these kidnappings
became a common refrain for
Empror Canack: they were plotting
against him. Of course, there
was never evidence of this at
any point over the years. Needless
to say, the Nobility of Prevalia
grew both very nervous and
extremely discontent with their
Emperor.









Emperor Canack's second wife
was discovered in her rooms by
a maid in waiting, who immediately
fled Prevalia upon witnessing
the horrors of what happened
to her former mistress.
When the Prevalian Guard found
the maid in waiting, she told them
of the gruesome scene in the
Empress' rooms. The visage
shook her so that she refused
to return willingly to Prevalia.
However, Emperor Canack ordered
her return. When she came back,
under escort of the guard, she was
promptly put into a rat pit.









Emperor Canack had two sons by his
third wife. He suspected both of the
little boys to be incestuously
involved with their mother, and
he simply would not tolerate such
unvirtuous behavior. The young
boys, of course, were far too young
to have any such proclivities, but
no amount of debate from the
Emperor's disenchanted council
could persuade him otherwise.
After feeding both of the children
to their mother, he then peeled the
skin off of her and hung it from the
Prevalian parapets.










The Emperor took one last wife
and when the day inevitably came
that he suspected her of some
horrible treason, he decided he
would order his guards to torture
and execute her. However, as
the Virtues smile upon us,
Emperor Canack never gave the
order. For that night the Emperor
suffered a fall from the battlements.

The exact cause of this fall
was never recorded.
