Of    <br>
Oblivion <br>

In the beginning there was
nothingness. Blackness began
infinite empty space. From this
infinite state of Oblivion came an
explosion of light, substance, and
ultimately life, spreading
itself far and wide across the
expanse of Oblivion.

Woe be to the one who stands
between Entropy and Oblivion!
Entropy, the ever-flowing chaos of
the infinite universe, the
ever-marching force of decay and
death that ultimately all things
succumb to.









Entropy is the penultimate tool
of the universe for reaching
its natural state: Oblivion.

And as Entropy is a tool for Oblivion
to reach nothingness, so mankind
is the ultimate tool of Entropy.
Chaotic and destructive by
nature, mankind's divine purpose
is to restore the natural balance
of the infinite, to restore complete
and total Oblivion.


Over the aeons, mankind emerged
from the swamps and rivers of 
the world. It was their natural
instinct to take up crude weapons
and slaughter one another, and this
primal instinct stayed with them
ever since. It is this primal urge that
is the pull of Entropy! So ingrained
into the very foundation of man's
being is this Entropic force that it
is blasphemous to deny it, for
denying it is to deny the ultimate
natural state of all things, which
is Oblivion.


Ages flowed like rivers, and once
disparate groups of mankind 
bonded together hamoniously
within their own social communes,
which gave shape to the larger
workings of Entropy: warfare.
The great many deaths of large
bands of humanity clashing together
feeds Oblivion mightily! The
destruction of entire towns and
cities, the consumption of
resources all turn the wheel of
Entropy, progressing ever-slowly
but inevitably towards total
nothingness. And so as humanity
matured, so did their prowess as
tools of Entropy.










The Church of Oblivion can be traced
back to the original world trapped
within the Gem of Immortality
prior to its shattering.

The Grand Entropic Patriarch was
the first to discern that the
natural state of all things is
nothingness, Oblivion. Humans are
born, merely to decay and die; trees,
plants, wildlife follow this cycle as
well with varying time spans. The
very earth itself, the rock, the
water, the sun, the stars, all
eventually transmute through the
force of Entropy into eventual 
nothingness. The very materials
of existence directly defile the
natural and supreme order of
Oblivion.

Traveling from world to world, the
Church of Oblivion has set up
numerous chapters to preach
the word of Entropy and
Oblivion, and the Church has
overseen the complete destruction
of numerous worlds.

The most faithful of mankind
understand that there is no greater
or more inevitable power than 
Oblivion, and to give oneself
freely into the service of Entropy
and Oblivion is to serve only the
greatest good imaginable.

To walk the path of complete
darkness is the only true salvation.



Much of society, in a mistaken
embrace of misinterpreted bygone
days, preac of suppressing the
basest desires all mankind has
beating within their chests. To deny
these urges, to deny these 
hungers is to deny the antideluvian,
primordial calling of Oblivion.

To sate your hunger for flesh, to sate
your desire for intimate knowledge of
the unknown, to give in to those
base urges is to hear the call of
Entropy and to fulfill your ultimate
purpose. To deny them is to commit
the ultimate sin. The act of murder
is seen as one of the vilest taboos
by almost all other blasphemous
and misguided pantheons. Those who
are misguided do not understand
that for each death that occurs, the
universe is one small step closer to 
its most natural and peaceful state.
No man, woman, nor child should
ever mourn one who dies, for
that one has fulfilled their greatest
purpose. No man, woman, nor child
should stay their hand when in
service to Oblivion.

You are the perfect vessel of
Entropy.Go forth and plunge your 
daggerinto the hearts of those who
do notserve Oblivion. Feed upon their
extinguishing light. Sow the seeds of
chaos in theripe fields of Entropy
blossominto the fruit of Oblivion.
