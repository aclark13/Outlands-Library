Deep and alone it doth lie
So ancient and forlorn
Waiting beneath the bluest sky
A secret that was born

From the ashes of the earth
The grumbling of rock
The secret smiles with mirth
Behind its aged lock

Forever it has slumbered
Until this day it wakes
No longer age encumbered
Comprised of rocks and lakes

Oh Mount Petram doth call to me
A secret for none to see

I met a lusty Andarian maid
Who said she shouldn't be paid
So with a tickle n' a pinch
I had grown almost an' inch
And she laughed so hard
I didn't get laid.

There was a wizard from Andaria Bay
Who would polish his wand ev'ry day
He'd oil up the shaft
Work his wizardly craft
and produce a most magical spray!

Oh m'lady, oh m'lady, Oh won't you
come quick!
Come look at the Orc warrior
handle his... stick!

It's as long as his arm
And as thick as his wrist
And the knob on the end is as big
as his fist!

Expert Orc Wordsmith

The Best of men are not warriors
The best of men are not fast
The best of men are those knights
That take pleasure in kickin' Orc arse

The Orc's arse is covered in crust
The Orc's arse is knotted and gnarled
The Orc's arse is soggy and worn
Cause Orcs don't wipe from the day
they are born!

The Orc's arse is chapped and crusty
The Orc's arse is covered in fleas
To kick an Orc's arse will take an hour
So get kickin' if'n you please!

-Knights Guild Bawdy Tavern Song

Hwaet! Praise to the prowess of the
mighty axemen, in days long past,
we have heard the honor and glory
of those nobles who performed
courageous deeds. Often the
great Champion Falkvan siezed
the mead benches from enemy
hosts, and terrorized the
fearsome Andari. He waxed
under the clouds, throve in honors
until to him each of the bordering
tribes beyond the old road had
to submit to him and yield
tribute. That was a good
Champion!
-Excerpt from Falkvan Wulfgar

There once was a man named Mudd
Who loved to drink all the blood
During a break
He made a mistake
What a terrible day for Mudd.

My Inferno, you inspire me to write
I love the way you burn and burn
Invading my mind day and night
Always I dream of the grand churn

Shall I compare you to an angry God?
You are more molten, blazing, burning
Black sun heats the preacher and sod
Blackened elemental turning

How do I love you? I'll count the ways
I love your Daemons, fire and fire
Thinking of burning fills my days
My love for you is the rectifier

Now I must away with heart yearning
Remember these words whilst burning

Landau, Landau
You're so lowbrow
Your mustach reminds me
of an eyebrow.

Your sharpened sword pokes
holes in me.
Holes for all the men to see.

Though this message may seem strange
Landau, Landau
I think not you are deranged.

Rough break of the day
A broad, bright sword flourishes
into the needle

Antique yesteryear
A sullen Petram explodes
under the ruby

Strong Prevalia
A stalwart quartent expands
because of the King

-Aiden Blass, Prevalian Poet
