In the year 449 AC, upon the
mysterious death of his father,
Emperor Reilquios ascended
the Prevalian throne.

After eight terrible and brutal
years under Emperor Canack
there was a wellspring of hope
for this new Emperor. Both
Cambria and Andaria looked
forward to re-establishing
formal diplomacy with the
Prevalian nobility. However,
as it would turn out, Emperor
Reilquios had a great deal of
his father in him.









Emperor Reilquios came into
the throne at the very young
age of twelve. It was a shock
to the Prevalian court when
the first order from the new
young Emperor was for the
arrest of his mother under the
suspicion of his father's murder.
He did not call for her execution
though, and instead he sent her
away to the Cloisters of the Sisters
of Honor, where she remained
for the rest of her days studying
the Virtues.











It is said that the young Emperor
enjoyed the company of a
traveling Alchemist, whos name
was never recorded in any official
logs, and so we do not know it.
Emperor Reilquios had a young
boy's curiosity for the potions,
poultices, and salves that the
Alchemist could concoct. But
what grabbed his attention
more than anything else was the
Alchemist's ability to concoct
poisons. More accurately, the
boy enjoyed applying the poison
and watching as unwitting servants
choked and died.









Within the first two years of his
reign, Emperor Reilquios hosted
a grand ball and invited a wide
host of Prevalian, Cambrian, and
Andarian nobility to attend, and
of course attend they did. The
feast was said to be unrivaled at
that point in time. Grand buffets of
iced desserts, succulent swan, roast
pheasant... all a delight for the
guest's senses. After less than half
an hour into the feast, the first of
the guests began to cough up blood.
Shortly after, they were joined by
others. By the end of the hour,
about half of the nobility
were dead.








According to the journal of the
Emperor's personal guard, it is
said that the young Emperor
absolutely delighted in seeing the
faces of the nobles as they
coughed up blood and clawed
at their throats for air. Indeed,
it was certainly appearing that
this Emperor would be very
much like his father.

When Emperor Reilquios hosted
another grand feast the following
year, almost no nobles were
in attendance, much to the ire
of the Emperor.









Emperor Reilquios did not take
kindly to the nobility of the
great Prevalian Empire not
attending his royal feast. He
ordered his guards to force
their attendance the following
week. Those who refused twice
did not live to do so a third time.
Compelled to the feast, the
Emperor had each guest in
attendance drink from cups set
in front of them. Half of them
were filled with poison so that
the Emperor could once again
enjoy with great mirth the
clawing of the dying.









Over the following decade,
Emperor Reilquios studied the
creation and effects of numerous
poisons from any and all
Alchemists and texts that he could
find. Each time he found a new,
particularly gruesome poison,
he held a large feast and
compelled guests to come. Each
time he would poison half of
the guests (a number that dwindled
with each passing year) and
laugh raucously as they died.












The Emperor became extremely
infamous over the years, and
the nobility of the Empire dimished
greatly. For his cruelty and
murderous intent, any and all
uprisings against him were
quelled immediately due to the
fact that Emperor Reilquios was
extremely generous with his
guards and soldiers, and did not
ever mistreat them. He was
cruel, but he was not stupid.
He understood that having a strong
military at his call would keep
him in power, and no number
of angry nobles could stop that.









It is written in the journals of
his attendants that the Emperor
was kind to both his wife and
his two sons, Leopold and Linus.
In spite of the incredibly high
noble deathtoll from his feasts,
he never poisoned those three.

But, as with all madmen, he was
unpredictable. The last great feast
that Emperor Reilquios held he
placed poison in the cup of his
wife with the full intention of
watching her suffocate to death
on her own hemorrhaging blood.










It is not without a twist of irony
that during that last great feast
in the year 472 AC that Emperor
Reilquios mistaken his wife's
cup for his own and drank the
poison. The guests at this
dreaded feast watched as the
Emperor died in a most gruesome
agony. It was a great relief
for the guests, to be sure.
Emperor Reilquios would be laid
to rest on the Walkway of
the Emperor, to be succeeded
by his eldest son, Leopold.
