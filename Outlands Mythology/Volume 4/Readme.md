In the year 472 AC, Emperor
Apparent Leopold and his brother
Linus attended the internment
of their father upon the Walkway
of the Emperor. The people of the
Empire, especially the nobility
breathed a collective sigh of relief
for Leopold was known to be
a kind and generous person, a
start contrast to both his father
and grandfather before him.
What should have been the end
to several dark decades was
actually the beginning of the
worst of the Mad Emperor's
reigns.









According to attendees of the
internment of former Emperor
Reilquios, Emperor Apparent
Leopold and his brother Linus
sorjourned on a walk of the
Walkway of the Emperor. Only
Linus ever returned from that
walk, with a stranger in tow.
Only rumors and wild stories exist
of what happened, but most insist
that Linus stabbed his brother
in the back. More fanciful stories
claim that Leopold's blood sprayed
across a gem set in his ancestor's
crypt which awakened a Shadowlord.










Whether or not the mysterious
advisor accompanying Linus was
truly one of the Shadowlords remains
a hotly debated topic to this day.
But what is without question is
how Linus only ever took advice from
this stranger, and never his own
royal council. One of the first
recorded pieces of council given
to Linus by this mystery advisor was
for Linus to kill any sons that he
would sire, for it is forseen that
his son would cause the death of him

Linus was crowned Emperor on
the day his brother should have been.









Emperor Linus married 'The Lady of
the Ice' Delia of house Hosenfield.
Over the course of the first few
years of his reign, they had many
children together.

At the advice of his sole advisor,
Emperor Linus threw each male
newborn off of the white cliffs
of Prevalia to be dashed on the
rockys below. These cliffs would
later become known as the
Sacrifical Cliffs. After multiple of
such incidents, Lady Delia came
up with a plan to save her next
male newborn.









When the day came for her to give
birth once more, and the discovery
that the baby was in fact a boy,
Lady Delia put her plan into action.

This newborn royal boy was switched
with a newborn girl belonging to
one of Delia's Ladies in Waiting. The
girl was presented to Emperor Linus
as his own daughter. The boy was
bundled up and sent quietly to
Andaria to live with one of Lady
Delia's sisters, to be raised as her
own. This boy would never learn
of his true identity, nor would he
ever become Emperor, as was his right.









Overjoyed with his newborn daughter,
Emperor Linus ordered for two new
holdfasts to be constructed, one
to the northwest of Prevalia in honor
of his wife (Delia Keep) and one just
south of Prevalia in honor of his new
daughter, Vell (Vell Keep). It is not
certain as to why these two locations
were chosen, but they were at the
behest of the strange advisor.
The craftsmen were initially reluctant
to build Vell Keep, but the strange
advisor made promises of certain
immortality for those who
undertook the work.
Both keeps were built.









It is uncertain as to exactly how
Emperor Linus learned of his wife's
deception. Some say that her
Lady in Waiting told Emperor Linus,
others say it was Lady Delia herself
who told him of the son that he
sired, who was sent to Andaria.

However he found out, Emperor
Linus was so angry, so betrayed,
that he forcibly threw both Lady
Delia and his daughter, Vell, from
the Sacrificial cliffs. Their wails
were said to have echoed off
the rocks for years to come.










In his rage, Emperor Linus ordered
for the executions of all soldiers
and attendants within both Delia
Keep and Vell Keep.

After the massive slaughter, Delia
Keep became known as Contempt
(which has since been reappropriated
by disgraced knights), and Vell
Keep became known as Forsaken
Keep. Whatever strange and
dark pact between the builders
of Forsaken Keep and Linus'
mysterious advisor was made, it
was clear that it was powerful, for
even today the dead walk the grounds.









In those final days, Emperor Linus
heeded the words of his dark
advisor. He ordered the killings of
many of his own council and nobles.
He had specific gems pried out
of their settings in the Walkway
of the Emperor, given to the advisor.
Nobody knows the reasons for any
of these actions except Linus
and the advisor himself.

Fueld by terrible rage, and at the
word of the dark advisor, Emperor
Linus threw himself from the
Sacrificial Cliffs, joining his children
and wife.









The reign of the Mad Emperors took
a dreadfully heavy toll on the
Empire at large, and the people.

When Emperor Linus died, there
was no clear heir left to the throne
(for his trueborn son and heir
never knew that the throne was
his to claim), both Andaria and
Cambria laid claim to the Prevalian
throne, touching off a civil war
that would destabilize the world
and cause a great many hardships
that we deal with even today.
