S.R. = Sosarian Reckoning;
Pre-cataclysm and ancient
Sosarian times.

(-500,000 S.R.)
The first to settle Sosaria was a
race of beings known only as the
Ancient Ones, who managed to
defeat the daemons who were trying
to claim the world as their own.
Binding the daemons to their will,
some of these beings vanished to
a higher state of being while others
became mortal. However, this is
mere speculation.










(-3,049 S.R.)

A human named Zog learns the spell
of Armageddon from the Wisps and
casts it for reasons unknown. The
entire world is essentially destroyed,
except Zog himself. This spell
disrupted the ether so severely
that any attempts in the future
to scry this point in time or
prior all lead to failure. The
bones of Zog are rumored to
exist even to this day.












(-1,000 S.R.)

Sosaria recovers from the
Armageddon spell. Ancient myth
tells that survivors of the spell
used magic gates to allow new
creatures and plant life into the
desolate world to help it recover.

(-500 S.R.)
The Esidin culture develops and
spreads across the world, developing
a diverse system of government,
magic, and ethics. It is said that the
Moonstones are ancient Esidin
artifacts.









(-500 S.R. Cont,)

The Esidin people fend off and defeat
an invasion of daemons who came
from another plane of existence.
The Esidin people constructed wards
to prevent these daemons from
entering Sosaria so freely in the
future. These wards presumably
exist to this day, but their locations
and physical properties are
completely unknown.













(0 S.R.)

The Ancient Liturgy of Truth is
written in the Esidin Empire, and
accurate records for dates and
calendars are recorded. The exact
date is known because of the
very advanced magical techniques
of sealing ethereal time stamps
into stone tablets which can still be
read and calculated today. After the
fall of the Esidin Empire, dates and
records become less specific.












(514 S.R.)

The Esiden Empire colonizes
Ambrosia, a small subcontinent.
Ambrosia is primarily dedicated to
various philosophies.

(1,001 S.R.)

Comets strike Ambrosia, killing
most of the inhabitants and
sinking the island. Myth tells that
the ethereal disturbances may have
pulled Ambrosia into its own
self-contained dimension, where
it may exist today.









(1,215 S.R.)

The city of Wind is founded. Two
different origin stories exist, one
statings that a rogue faction of
mages from the Esidin Empire
broke away and started the city,
others say refugees from Ambrosia
settled it.

(1,500 S.R.)

The Esidin Empire crumbles and
falls for unknown reasons. The only
surviving city is Wind, which
isolates itself through magic.









(2,192 S.R.)

Two major human cultures emerge
in Sosaria from the broken factions
of the former Empire. Several
other species emerge at this time,
including Elves, Dwarves, Bobbits,
and Fuzzies. They are fewer in
number than humans.

Mondain, using the Gem of
Immortality, travels to this point
in time to rule over Sosaria, causing
'a thousand years of chaos.' This
coincides with the removal of the
Codex from the Void by the
Gargoyles.








(2,975 S.R.)

Several Sosarian nations, including that
of Akalabeth, form an alliance against
the giant monsters of Sosaria, including
the cylopses and titans. After multiple
decades of fighting, these giants
are driven underground until
the time of Mondain's ascension
to power.

(3,142 S.R.)

A man named Cantabrigian arrives
in Sosaria through the use of a
medallion in the shape of a Silver
Serpent.








(3,142 S.R. Cont,)

Wolfgang, the King of Akalabeth,
welcomes his first son into the
world (the older brother of the
wizard Mondain). There is nothing
else recorded of this child. It is
hypothesized that Mondain destroyed
all records of his brother, perhaps
out of jealousy due to Wolfgang
doting more upon upon the older
brother.

(3,172 S.R.)

Minx is born. Continued next volume...
