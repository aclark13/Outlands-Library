Dryad

The fair and beautiful Dryads
speak their magic with such
soft and clear voices that it is
no wonder that they have
a certain command of the
natural forces that commonly
surround them.

One could sit for many hours
and observe the elegant beings
as they dance joyfully in the
company of more elusive spirits,
and after that one is certain
that no one with good intentions
would ever wish harm upon
such a soothing creature.






Creeping Soil

The living soil found in Darkmire
is a reclusive phenomenon that
prefers to spend its' days in
wherever the shadows are
the deepest, and rarely step into
the light. Except for when
they curiously and rather without
a sense of personal space, will
examine explorers that come
too close, inadvertently resulting
in the occasional bodily harm.
Rarely seen and a little known
fact is that most of the Creeping
Soils sport a well kept moustache,
likely copied from adventurers
which they have observed.






Sentient Vines

If one sits very still and quiet
one can sometimes observe
the curious Dryads as they
let a small spark of life
energy float away amongst
the underbrush and pick up
all sorts of plants and weeds.

The ball of vines that result seem
to have some sort of sentience
and serve just as much as sentries
as the Dryads' playthings.







Fey Spirit

As I was gathering a few
botanical samples of utmost
scientific importance, I noted
a tiny wisp of green light that
quickly whizzed past my field
of vision. Thinking little of this,
I cut off the small flower that
had interested me, and much to
my surprise, the little green light
came racing towards me and
pricked my hand with such fierce
anger that it drew a few drops of
blood. Careful not to offend
the spirits of the Fey anymore, I
left all my instruments and
quickly withdrew.






Fey Spirit Matron

I noted that amongst the
largest trees sometimes lived
a more prominent spirit. To me,
it had a strong resemblance to
the queen bees as the nexus of
the bee activities. However this
motherly spirit had nothing of the
crudeness of insects. Instead it
embodied the most wonderful
thing that the observer could
imagine, and for me it appeared as
a beautiful woman, but to my
friend, keen on the liquor, it
appeared as a grand bottle of
Cambrian Whiskey, or at least
so he claimed.






Creeping Earth

I think I have found conclusive
evidence that the creeping
earth of Darkmire are in fact
time travellers who have
warped into our realm from
the Weiyrd dimension, the
place of legend which birthed
ye Olde Gods of the cosmos.
The revelation came to me
strongly as I accidentally inhaled
the mind altering vapors which
are left behind as the creeping
earth apparate into reality.
It is too dangerous for me to
write more however, as I am
being spied on by the trees.






Giant Poison Dart Frog

These amphibious creatures
are not native to the Darkmire.
Rather they are domesticated,
much like cattle, and used for
their poisonous secretions which
are synthesized in the frog's skin
and excreted to cover it in a thin
film of luminescent slime.

The Darkmire Tribals are quite
fond of their frogs, and often give
them names of their own.
To my surprise, the frogs are
quite social creatures will emit
pleasant ribbits when you pat them
on the head or scratch their chin.






Otyugh

The eldritch nightmare fuel
deep in the catacombs of the
Darkmire is manifested in the
terrible monstrosity that is
the Otyugh. It is composed out
of squishy and semi-translucent
jelly and sports the most
impressive round jaw filled with
countless razor sharp fangs. It is
tended by one of the warriors
of the Darkmire tribe, however
hardly able to control it and more
likely there to serve as a warm
meal. The acid excretions left
behind after such a feast can be
turned in the most lethal poison.






Darkmire Tribal

Despite what the rumours say,
the Darkmire tribe of humans
who inhabit the temple, are one
of the ancient civilizations in
Avadon. They worship the idea
of transformation through the
power of the mind. One of the
tribal warriors, Ughh'tjicca, told
me vividly over a hot cup of
anaconda blood, the story of old
man Byle, known to even the
the most feeble of the Darkmire,
and how he jumped into the belly
of an Otyugh and metamorphosed
into a being of enormous power.






Darkmire Elder

Despite the friendliness of
some of the Darkmire inhabitants,
these wizened and teethless
elders do not take too kindly
to strangers. The elders have
mastered a crude form of magic,
spending most of their time
amongst the hallucinatory vapors
of the poisonous frogs and
colossal black widows. Their
frail apperance do not give much
credibility to their preachings
of transformations through
the power of the mind.






Swamp Dragon

I came upon a large hall lit by
several roaring fires, revealing
a wealth of emerald green plants,
the most clean and fresh I have
ever felt, constantly being filtered
through the greenery. Walking
amongst the halls were a few
of the Draconids which so often
inhabit places of power. The
Swamp Dragons have melded
with aspects of nature, and one
can see the symbiosis as the
power of the Dragons keep the
halls evergreen and the
surrounding plants in turn
greatly enhance their powers.






Arboreal Wisp

The Arboreal Wisps can be found
in the ruins of an ancient
wildwood, protecting the
remains of the old spirit and
tending to its' dried old roots so
that no harm will come to it.

The affinity of the intelligent
Wisps to the sorcerous trees,
long after they have lost their
potency, show that there is more
to their connection than meets
the eye. If only I could
understand the words of
their magical language.






Wildwood Reaper

The magical trees of the Darkmire
have been infused with a
viciousness rarely seen elsewhere
in Avadon. The Wildwood Reapers
of the Temple are constantly
pestered by innumerable small
toxic insects which bite into its'
thick bark and gnaw away the
cambium layer within, leaving
gaping sores oozing with
lukewarm sap which fall off
in big clumps. The trees have
developed a coating of razor
sharp bristles, entirely
ineffectual to the insects but
very deadly for everything else.






The Terrorwood

The Terrorwood grew for many
centuries right next to his
beloved partner tree, which
always flowered with the most
beautiful roses. However when
the love of his life slowly wilted
and died after falling under the
corruption of the Darkmire, he
called the arboreal wisps to watch
her remains. The Terrorwood
grew mad with sorrow and
unrooted himself in an attempt
to end his existence, but the
noxious fumes of the Temple
kept him alive, leaving him to
thrash about in constant agony.








Lord Bile

The Darkmire tribals all talk
warmly of the old Lord Bile who
lives inside the Temple. He is
an abomination if I ever saw one,
slithering on his belly and leaving
trails of slime. Often he will
release a great cloud of the most
depraved noxious gases, which
even cause the surrounding
rocks to burn as if etched by acid.
They say he was once one of
the elders, who through intense
use of various substances and
a great deal of experimentation,
finally reached what they believe
is the ultimate human form.
