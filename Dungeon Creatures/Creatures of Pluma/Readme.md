Shallow Water

Broken and incomprehensible
technology litters the hallways of the
sunken hold that is known as Pulma.
Some of it is still alive with
an unknown and strange power.

This power will sometimes
leap out from the walls and
into puddles of water, and
turn some globs of water into
buzzing and mischievous
creatures which zip around
causing all sorts of harm until
it touches some exposed machination,
electrocuting them and
causing the water to evaporate.








Precursor Sentry

The Sentries of Pulma
carry around a mechanical
contraption in their hand, a small
little cube which every so often
will start screeching with a loud
noise and send many light beams
across the surroundings to reveal
anything in the dark shadows.

I was given such device to study
and regret that I made the
mistake to open the shutters of
the box for too long, as the small
bolt of lightning contained within
quickly escaped and broke my
window as it shot right through it.








Writhing Tentacle

Make no mistake when you
see these long tendrils creeping
around. They may seem like
living beings, but once sliced
open with a sharp blade, you will
reveal that they are just a thin
layer of artificial skin covering
thick cords of copper wiring.

At the top end are some sharp
pieces of metal, as if a mouth,
however it is not connected to
any sort of digestive system,
instead it seems only to shred
things into pieces for no other
reason than the joy of it.









Observer

There are some rather odd
creatures made out of thin
layers of metal sheets and held
together by some unseen force,
often attracting anything in
its' vincinity that is also made
from metal. And with so many
little bits of this and that
lying around in the halls, the
creatures soon become
overburdened with all the scraps
and will take any opportunity
to discharge their energy and
dislodge their scraps unto the
armor of any careless explorer.









Overseer

The Overseers of Pulma are hard
to wrap your head around. They
are heavily armored with large
and thick sheets of some blueish
metal which cover tendons and
muscle made out of warm flesh.
Numerous wires insert into
mechanic switches that line their
backs, and somehow the
Precursor Engineers seem to be
able to control the Overseers
through some sort of pale black
magical wand or flattened stick
which is covered with buttons
of various colours.









Precursor Technologist

Whispers oft speak of a greater
master somewhere far beneath
the horror pit that is Pulma.
The Precursor Technologists are
said to be the most direct spawn
of this... thing. These creatures
seem to be tasked with the general
maintenance and upgrading of
the other various Precursors found
throughout Pulma.

The technologists usually carry
a set of cleverly manufactured
tools which can be used to either
manipulate matter around them
or shoot shocking bolts at you.








Precursor Operator

The Precursor Operators reveal
the hideous truth of what
happend to the humans who were
still inside the Dam when
the takeover happened. I saw
an Operator as he connected
himself with some of the
mechanoid robots, using wires
from his neck, and to my
horror, he unscrewed his entire
head and left it at some sort
of strange station, revealing
that he must be a human-metal
hybrid which was exactly the
subject of infamous research
by the late Professor Zye Burgius.








Precursor Warden

The worst of the mechanoids
of Pulma is the Warden, whose
grinding and never-once greased
gears, produce a distinct clicking
noise, only overpowered by
the massive roar of the huge
rotorblades which keep it
hovering over the floor. It wields
an axe the size of horse carriage
and in the other hand a grim
set of claws able to cut through
anything like butter. Its' sole
purpose apparently to make sure
that nothing makes it out alive.










Dark Water

A little known fact is that
all of the sewers of Prevalia
empty through ancient pipes
to large collecting pools deep
within the bedrock of the
mountains beneath Pulma.

This doesn't bother the people
of Prevalia as much as it
bothers the explorers of Pulma,
as they suddenly find themselves
attacked by excrementals
consisting mostly of vile scum
and human waste.










Deep Devourer

These blind and flesh eating
beasts inhabited the primordial
pool beneath Pulma for millenia
before the light of day came
crashing down upon them some
odd centuries ago. They have
during that time, been able to
feed well upon all the human
explorers who have tried to
reach the bottom of the depths.
While the Devourers are usually
small amoeba-like beings in their
natural and nutrient deprived
state, they have managed to
grow into monstrous proportions
with the food availible in Pulma.








Befuddler

The fungaloid Befuddlers are
grown out from small seed pods
that have found a special kind
of ecosystem within the cracks
of the marble tiles in the dungeon.
Like other mushroom men, they
are of limited intelligence, and
rarely take interest in interaction
with the human explorers of
Pulma. They are controlled
by a very strict internal rythm
and thus on most days their
only focus will be to find
things to slowly digest in their
large sack-like mouths.









Drowned Dragon //TEST: TOO LONG

Several old beings of magic
were for a long time trapped in
the great lake beneath Pulma,
amongst them a host of dragons
whose flesh been soaked by
the water and fallen off in pieces

The powerful sorcery of these
reptilians in syngergy with the
natural forces of the depths
below ground, caused them to
carry on life after death in
service of some strange master.
These Dragons shy away from
the natural light and spend all
their time under the surface.








Drowned Daemon

I followed the map given to me
very carefully, pointing to a
hidden path behind a waterfall
through a hole in the marble walls.
The room was void of the usual
mechanoids and other pests.
Thinking little of it, a feeling
of imminent doom set upon me
as my heart beat begun to slow
and my vision faded. I saw
the blurred shape of a daemonic
presence materialize from the
blue pools of water under me.
As the blood drained from my
veins, I blacked out and fell
and tumbled through the waterfall
and to the other side to safety.







Ancient Drowned Dragon

The markings on the bones of
one of the drowned dragons, in
the tounge of the draconids, read
Reu'lsk, sister of Rul'itz. One
familiar with dragon lore, then
realizes that this Undead being
must be the sibling of the mythical
emperor dragon of Nusero.
The sister, despite being ruined in
the waters over millenia, has lost
none of her natural strength as
she is now bonded into
servitude to the unknown master
of Pulma.










Great Sunken Serpents

Passing under a hidden waterfall,
I found a few expansive halls,
which bore a direct connection
to the primordial lake that
Pulma once harnessed.
The ankle-deep water was
disturbed by my steps, and
suddenly I was pulled away and
into the depths. Breathless, and
with flailing arms, the crushing
weight of the water above grew
heavier and heavier. Several long
slithering creatures surrounded
me, and only by luck my cloak
tore away and obscured the water,
allowing my escape to the surface.


















Frozen Dead

Arisen from the wintery blanket
of the everfrost that covers
great cave of Cavernam, and
illuminated by the otherwordly
stars that twinkle in the never
ending night above, these
Undead with their cold bones will
with a frightening desperation
claw at any living thing that
comes remotely close, not
hesitating even to consume the
tiny sparks of undead force
from the frozen remains that
often follow it around.






Opilion Attendant

The insectoid species called
the Opilions thrive in the freezing
temperatures which have allowed
their silicate brains operate
at a higher level than any other
of the ant species of Avadon.

Thus they have managed
to build great structures out
of densely packed ice, where
they live in a complex society
and where the attendants are
the foremost servants to the
master of all ants, the great
conservators.






Acarid

The Acarids with their tiny
little legs supporting a round
and bloated up body filled with
frozen webs, will skitter about
barely leaving more than a little
pockmark in the snows that it
traverses. It's ever restless
trying to find something to trap,
but never finding anything other
the odd frozen ice cube that may
or may not contain some unhappy
rabbit which found the cavern
entrance, but most often having
to settle to suckle on the marrow
of some old and frozen bones.







Ursal Forager

The worshippers of the cave
bears who sought refuge within
the great cavern and were
subsequently trapped when
the world shook and the
entrance was blocked for many
long years, have stayed so long
on the glistening plains that
all of the more primal denizens
of Cavernam have long grown
tired of the taste of their meat,
and thus they are free to roam
the caves unharmed atop their
bears, and listen to the
echoes of the throatsingers as
they call upon the Ursa.






Nagalid

The Nagalids with their iridescent
scales and their forked tounges
were one of the most nefarious
beings that I encountered. They
caught me as I trod through the
waist deep snow, but to my luck
their long spears only caught the
thick fur mantle which was
ripped off, leaving my exposed
skin burning with the cold air and
prompting me to escape quickly.
I will leave the Nagalids to
the worship of the great
sturgeon God of the ice, and
bother them no more.






Frozen Fury

The Frozen Furies with their evil
eyes are kept as dog like pets
by the Nagalids who feed them
blind and translucent slimefish.
They have great sense of smell,
something which the Nagalids
themselves lack entirely.

With their large arms they are
able to heave themselves forward
at chilling speeds, if any advice
is to be given it is to keep a sharp
object pointed in front of oneself
as these frozen furies do not seem
to even remotely register any
sense of danger to themselves.






Hoarfrost

Playful winter spirits will
on occasion build a snowman,
with eyes and a nose plucked
from the frozen corpse of some
adventerurer. Instead of
letting such creations being
spoiled, they cup their hands and
blow a tiny cold breath of
magical air into the rolled up
snow, and without fail twirl
around in joyous mischief
as these snowy abominations
take upon a life on their own
and begin to shuffle around
the rime lakes without any
particular purpose.






Rime Spirit

The great rime lake houses
one of the ancient artifacts
of Avadon, the puzzle key
to the frozen kingdom which
has been locked up so long and
just recently made its' presence
known by the unrelenting cold
that has crept out from the
mountains north of Outpost.

The Rime Spirits are the summons
conjured up from the sorcerous
power of the sword imbedded
in the heart of the winter king,
and serve to guard it from the
prying hands of tomb raiders.






Cave Gorger

If the peanut brain of the
Cave Corger would be compared
to the human operator of any
vessel of similar impressive
potential, one could view it
as if the most grand royal
galleon would be under the
control of the most vile drunkard
from the Prevalia slums and
heading at full mast straight for
the jagged rocks. Unaccountable,
the peanut brain with its' nerve
tendrils is in utterly unpredictable
command of this hulking mass of
flesh to be avoided at all cost.






Rhinocerus Beetle

There's something about the
the undisturbed and sharp cold
that allow things to grow into
enormous proportions.

The Rhinocerous Beetle was
first noticed in its' chrysalis stage
closely imitating the otherwise
huge crystalline formations that
jut out of the walls of the
chaorite mines. When disturbed
they quickly hatch and will
often lead to a shut down of
operations for a few days until
the have been calmed enough
to be tamed and put to work.






Wendigo

The psychotic and man-eating
evil spirits native to the shadows
will pop into reality with a
bang loud enough to shatter
fragile stalagmites as their
long and grabby hands will rip
apart anyone who caught their
interest, even if it's another
one of their own species,
not ashamed at all for their
cannibalistic tendencies.

They are named Wendigos as an
onomatopoeitic representation of
the bone chilling screams that
can be heard in the dark.






Barbed Prowler

After using my mortar and
pestle to grind some chaorite
powder to a dust, and then
under the somewhat unhealthy
influence of my companions,
snorting it right into my hot blood,
I summoned the courage to sprint
towards the cold dwelling barbed
prowlers and with utmost agility
jump onto it's strong back.
It was a short and wild ride before
it impaled my guts with it's huge
sharp tail and threw me crashing
into a pool of cold water which
to my luck froze my blood and
saved me from bleeding out.






Frigid Archfiend

The Archfiends are frozen beasts
guarding winding passages within
Cavernam. They are born from
the influence of the magical
frost that is formed by the cold
breath of the Basilisk who
quietly snores under the black
sun that has stolen the light
of the deep dungeons. It was
these fiends that prevented me
exploring further, as I sent
my travelling companion to
investigate, and witnessed him
immediately be turned into a
frozen sculpture, I decided that
it was time to turn back home.






Great Abyssal Hornbeast

The Hornbeasts, actually native
to the jungle islands of the
southern ocean, absolutely
detest the cold. The humongous
creature, called the Great
Abyssal Hornbeast, had been
frozen in the ice for many
geological aeons and when it
thawed it found itself atop
the peak of Crag Mountain in
Cavernam. It has slowly been
growing in size as it snatches
away and eats up a crag daemon
here and there, but it has not yet
mustered the courage to
escape from the dangerous peak.






Behemoth Basilisk

Only rumours exist of the
Basilisk of Cavernam, as none
who has seen it has been able
to return alive and tell the tale.
According to rumour, the creature
guards an intricate ice crystal which
serves as a sort of beacon between
two worlds. Once broken, this
beacon would summon the heralds
of the frozen kingdom and allow
them to enter our realm. I believe
it would be a great peril to do so,
and it is best for all of Avadon
to let this great Basilisk continue
its slumber under the cold snow.
