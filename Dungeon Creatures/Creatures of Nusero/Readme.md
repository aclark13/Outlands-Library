Primordial

This two legged reptile sports
several large and sharp talons
on both of its' strong lower legs.

Despite its' fearsome appearance,
it will prefer eating bugs, worms
and small rock snakes that it digs
out from the porous limestone.

Often viewed by the less
scholarly as precursors to the
magnificent dragons, the
Primordial is in fact unrelated
and is closer in lineage to
toads and other bug eaters.






Monitor

A reptile that is slow and lazy,
a bland gray color taken from
the soft rocks which they churn
in in their large mouths all day.

It prefers to stay areas close to
still water, required for the
maturation of their hatchlings
into adult monitors.

Its' weak and blunt fangs can
prove a nuisance for the curious
observer, however the monitor
is not known to hunt for meat.






Stonescale Tribal

These reptilioid creatures skulk
around upright on their two legs.
Their forked tounge able to
produce naught more than
an unintelligble hiss, surely
meaningless even to themself,
such as they are often heard
hissing in the dark whilst all alone
as if rambling mad if such thing
were possible from beasts.

They lack the finesse of an animal
and the intelligence of a man, an
abomination in the true sense
and quite possibly an accident
magical in nature long ago.







Chameleon

The masters of camouflage are
not the same as the slow and
colourful dimwitted things that
your aunt used to keep for pets.

These creatures are formidable
stealthers that with not even
a sound, and not a movement
in the air will wander far and wide
in search of their ill-fated prey.

They rarely even draw breath
and they are entirely cold blooded
never seeking warmth or light.
After weeks of observing I'm
still not sure if they are real.






Army Ant

The minions of the hive mind
can be found crawling over
a mound of minced rock and dirt.
There is something particularly
frightening about mindless
insects with a lust for blood.

I observed that they will not
find you objectionable if you
are coated in the soot from
the ember drakes. For what
purpose I do not know. However
from the tiny openings in
the mound one can feel warm air
flow. I suspect a Queen
in the depths, of fiery nature.






Asp

As any herpetologist worth
their salt would say
a sufficiently poisonous
snake has a place in any
ecosystem. To no surprise,
then, one can find these
delicate slithering Asps
in the dark of the dungeon.

I was not able to
witness at first hand the
strength of their venom,
however to make their
home here, it must be
something extraordinary.






Ophidian Dragonguard

These slithering monstrosities
tower high above a normal man.
I found after careful work with
a blade that their armor was
just a metallic inclusion in
their otherwise leathery skin.

Inside of the cartilage skull I
found something vaguely
resembling a brain. My hand was
stayed further, however, due
to the stench of reptilian magic.
Surely a cursed tether of some
kind, enslaved by the Dragons
to do their bidding in life and
apparently after death.






Wyvern Hatchling

These wondrous beings of
the most exquisite emerald
green entranced me to such
a degree that I almost forgot
the dangerous situation I was in.

They appear not to be Dragons
and I sense nothing magic or
ancient about them. They lack
wings for flight and seem
fully commited to a life in caves.

The acid breath of the adult
variant soured the air and burned
my nine-o-clock shade right
off my cheeks from far away.






Flame Purger

This leathery bag of volatile
fuels I regard as an anomaly
of nature. It appears to me
that the word self-combustion
was invented for this very beast.
However it seems not to explode,
not even as the sharp prick
of an heavy bolt releases the
pressurized gases from its' guts.

After spewing it's fiery contents,
you will find it a folded mess
of oily skin over sharp bones,
before it bloats once more and
by that time I would make sure
to not be anywhere close.






Eldritch Dragon

I regard these fantastical beast
with great veneration. Their
wings when fully extended
will make any man impressed.

Their skin was sizzling with purple
and wondrous patterns. They
appeared intelligent, inhabiting
ancient ruins in the depths of
the dungeon. Perhaps their affinity
to magic drawing them like
moths to a flame. They were
calling forth powerful magic
between one another as a game,
these beasts would have been
the marvel of any royal court.






Ember Dragon

Unaffected by the great
lava waterfalls that lights up
the darkness of the depths,
these Ember Dragons do not seem
have interest for anything
other than destruction and chaos.

In their eyes I saw nothing
of the curiosity that marks
the other magical reptilians.
Like so many beings of fire they
seemed to have been born from
the infernal depths below and
had no interest in the cold
world to which they had been
delivered.






Burning Ash Tree

No different than other evil
trees in the world. This ancient
and gnarled guardian grew at
a conflux of magical energies
of both life and destruction.

I observed this at first hand as
the seeds on bread which
I had brought suddenly sprouted
and set fire to my cloak.
With my quick wit I threw
the cloth away and soon small
plants started to rise,
surely within years to be
the scourge of those who
pass there after me.






Smoke Dragon

A mystical beast seldom spoken
of, for the fear of drawing its'
ire. Unfounded superstitions,
of course, but one can not
deny that there are reasons
to be afraid of the dark.

The slight scent of burned coal
will alert the observant fool
that they are in the presence
of a Smoke Dragon. These
reptilians do not use magic but
seem to have mastered the
natural aspects of the shadows.
As always, we have much to
learn from the Dragons.






Pit Dragon

The mighty dragon of the Pit
is kept in constant darkness in
its own cave and only unleashed
when called upon by its master.
The Pit Dragon, whose original
dragon aspect has been lost to
time, was once rattled by chaos
sorcery dulling its intelligence
to such a degree that it is
barely more sentient than
the average Asp. However with
the loss of it's higher functions,
only the primal rage remained
and its magical powers grew to
grotesque and violent proportions
in the vacant room of its mind.






Emperor Dragon

A favourite story of many common
folks is that of the ancient order
of the Dragon Lords who were
the kings of men before written
history was recorded. The story
tells of the Emperor Dragon who
resided in a magma chamber deep
beneath the crust of the earth.
Anyone could seek an audience
and have his or her worth tested.
There were two outcomes, either
they were burned to ashes or
they emerged with a golden
crown atop their head and with
the ability to wield many new
found powers.
