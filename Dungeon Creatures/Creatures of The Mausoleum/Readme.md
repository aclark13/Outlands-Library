Spare Parts

Loosely held together with
soft connective tissue this
walking, and sometimes
talking, hodge-podge of
body parts serve as a storage
to keep the parts needed for
experiements fresh.

Sometimes the odd bit of
slushed up brain juice will
remain within as evidenced by
their aversion to loud noise
and lights and their limited
sense of self-preservation.






Shambler

The janitors of the gloomy
halls of the Mausoleum called
the Shamblers, for their slow
and shuffling gait as they
carefully sweep the floors with
mops made from long haired, and
often reanimated, severed heads
wildly protesting their use.

They are entirely ineffective as
the corridors remain caked in
blood and scrambled body parts.
The Shamblers not quite
concocted in the right way remain
a failed experiment, only part
capable to serve their purpose.






Abomination

With the more unsavory body
parts of the lower extremities
left to build the flesh hounds,
who even manages to invoke
a tiny sense of modesty amongst
these depraved experimenters,
the abominations were left
over with the upper bodies which
have been without much purpose
stacked upon one another. And
if one looks closely, you will find
that even the so-called legs are
an upside-down half torso. So
many are the arms that they
have no shortage of them to
violently throw at explorers.







Calamity

In the dizzy aftermath of a
wild and alcohol-infused binge
on the high-octane bile harvest
from a shipment of recently
deceased drunkards, the
insane reanimators created the
Calamities, which are rolling
balls of flesh made from things
you could never guess and look
like nothing you have ever seen.

They are excellent guards with
their long and sleek tendrils like
jellyfish, that will hold you in place
until all your useable parts
have been cut away.






Insane Reanimator

The scientists of the Mausoleum
are often described as insane,
and truly there is a fine line
between brilliance and madness.

Not having seen the light of day
for many decades, they have
become as pale as bone, with
only the slight tint of blue and
deoxygenated blood shining
through, as they seldom need
to draw breath to sustain the one
or two remaining brain cells still
ticking in there, in these heads
gone off the far end a long time
ago never looking back.






Reanimated Pirate

Any old sea dog will recognize
the old Burly Joe who could
not live down the fact that he
lost both his legs and were left
with wooden pegs, in addition
to the already double set of
hook-hands, and let's not
mention what they say was
down in his pantaloons, an
unfortunate accident when a
loud noise startled a working
lady during an otherwise
pleasant time. Burly Joe now
has all his parts back, except
his brain which sit in a jar,
deemed too prone to malfunction.






Reanimated Daemon

In the master reanimators
laboratorium which is hidden
away from the rest of the
Mausoleum, one can witness
the real potency of the bubbling
homunculus-soup that once
upon a time drew these wizards
towards experimenting with
making their own variants of life.

The reanimated daemon which
skulks around along with other
creatures completely out of
place, is a mess of soft pink flesh
loosely held together and prone
to fall apart when disturbed.






Shadow Minion

A whole different cast of
mystical creatures inhabit
the more ancient and lower
levels of the Mausoleum, the
least impressive of them is
the Shadow Minion, which can
be found hissing and spitting at
anything that its' jealous green
eyes slightly can get a sight of
in the gloomy darkness.

The pets and playthings of their
more senior masters, they will
announce the arrival of any
intruder into their halls with
horrific screeching.






Apparition

This ectoplasmic manifestation
is not a true spirit of the dead but
rather something formed out
of spontaneity from the life
giving soup that simmers below
and has seeped through the
cracks of the large granite slabs
that pave the Mausoleum floors.

Like ectoplasm found elsewhere,
the Apparition must be evidence
of a powerful psychokinetic mind
somewhere in the depths below,
generating a strong force
of permeating life energy.






Blightmare

A good horse is said to have
a spirit of it's own and the
Blightmares found in the prison
of souls deep in the Mausoleum
would make one inclined to
believe stories such as that.

These particular mounts, however
have been reanimated and trod
the earth again as undead, kept
in the most pristine condition by
their riders, who are none other
than the feared and undying
vampiric lords.






Shadowguard

In the ancient depths amongst
the wails of the damned lies
the prison of souls where those
cursed in life come to serve their
punishment once they have died.

The Shadowguard serves as
the prison warden, watching
over the lost and forgotten
souls that crowd the tiny cells.

A being of dark energy, it never
tires in its' vigilance or in its'
fervor to torture the inmates.






Nightstalker

As one of the phase shifters
that can be found around
Avadon, the Nightstalker is
an elusive beast that has made
itself a home in the prison
of damned souls.

En ethereal shimmer in the air
will alert you of the Nightstalker's
presence, and one must take much
care not to accidentally step on
the long and sleek tail that will
trail behind it. That is otherwise
sure to draw it's anger and it's
enormous jaws with a thousand
razor teeth will sever you in half.






Elder Vampire

Enormous paintings can be found
depicting formidable men and
women with the most marvelous
costumes one could imagine,
their skin pale and bloodless.

As I ventured further and came
close to the great hall of the
Vampiric Lords, I was struck down
by a powerful presence that in
an instant wilted down the agility
of my mind's thought and turned
me feeble and forgetful. Only
by luck did I not draw attention,
as my companion pulled me out,
the details lost to me in a blur.






Cistern Gorgon

An oddity in the prison of souls,
the Cistern Gorgon inhabits a
large pool of water, where it is
forever bound by an invisible
leash. It usually takes the beautiful
form of a stark naked young
lady, tempting lustful explorers
to gaze into its' eyes, and before
they are able to see the dozens
of snakes that are coiled around
her head, they are turned into
stone. The Gorgon will then
throw the statue into the depths
of the pool to join the countless
others down in the dark waters.






Gatekeeper

I suspect that the Gatekeeper is
one of the vampiric lords, formerly
men, who sold their souls to the
the Shadowlords in exchange for
a morsel of forbidden knowledge.

The strong will of the Gatekeeper
permeates the Mausoleum and
invades the thoughts of anyone
who dares to enter. Feeding
off the souls of those so caught,
he is able to use his power to
pry open small cracks in the
fabric of reality and glean ever
more secrets from the mysterious
Shadow Realm beyond.
