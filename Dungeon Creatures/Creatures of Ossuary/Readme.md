Necromancer

This apparition, a sorcerer
mediocre at best, returned
from beyond the grave out
of self-indulgence or fear.

The many adorned golden rings
on his yellowed knuckles and
decaying but once fancy robes,
bear witness to his greed. And
it is evident that little else
apart from malice and evil
sour the mind of this shade
of one who barely had human
qualities in life and even
less so after death.






Fire Ant

A little known fact of these
insects is that they are one
of the most important ingredients
to the famous Cambrian
Knockout wine. Once ground
to a fine powder, after dried,
the ants turn into the hottest
spice known to man, which will
burn away your mouth in the
most enjoyable manner.

Ironic that the defenses
that made them unappetizing
to other creatures turned them
into prey for humans. Didn't
expect to be turned into wine.






Scarab

The husked beetles of the
Ossuary have by tradition been
given the name of Scarabs,
a reference to the ancient
stories of powerful beetles
which granted both luck and
could curse the more unsavory
adventurer.

Perhaps there is some truth
to the old legends, however,
as the beetles are worshipped by
the cultists of the Ossuary who
claim to be able to pry forth
their secrets and power.







Ossuary Embalmer

There is a certain cultist
that would prepare the dead
on their journey to the realm
beyond death, or perhaps
to prepare the body for its'
eventual return. The rites of
the Ossuarian cultists are
not readily apparent.

However, the mastery wielded
by this sickly human over fluids
and the bodily tissues was clear.
In the care of his stained and
wax-like hands, the recently
deceased soon looked better
than new.






Skeletal Marksman

Like many undead the marksman
is a vile machination of dark
magic. A reanimated husk of
old bones, all of them not
from the same corpse.

With no will of it's own, like a
tool, it will do it's master's bidding
It is easy to avoid these
mindless drones, however
do not underestimate them.

Their barbed arrows often
find a target in living flesh, and
once pinned down, you will soon
become a welcome snack.






Skeletal Fiend

The skeletal fiend did not seem
as if it was summoned as an
agent of some nefarious
sorcerer. Rather it was
something born from just the
sheer collection of old bones
and skulls that were so
plentiful in the Ossuary.

It appears to take great pleasure
in dismembering the ill-fated
adventurers that happen upon
it's small crypt, and decorates
its' crypt with body parts and
blood. Likely a misunderstood
creature, but very dangerous.






Rag Witch

Under the billowing robes of
the terrifying rag witch one
can find a howling and dried up
old woman with brown teeth
and wildly grown white hair.

Her eyes, tinted yellow by a build
up of toxic bile, will often be the
last thing you see, as you will
soon realize this is indeed not
your grandmother's tea party.
Despite the cannibalism she
remains wafer thin and her
hunger is just as insatiable as
the tendency to apparate at
the least opportune moment.






Nightmare

The nightmares so called
as their jet black and swirling
manes conjure up memories
of nocturnal frights.

Doubtless they are the steeds
of the rag witches, who at times
can be seen as wisps of
shadow riding out of Ossuary
at night to spread terror in
the world of troubled sleepers.

Despite their appearance they
are indeed animals, and if you have
a strong enough hand you will
find a mount of no comparison.






Sphinx

A curious being of the old world
and especially fond of riddles and
mysteries, it is then no surprise
that it can be found in close
companionship some of the
other more elusive beings in
the Ossuary.

Likely, it is a variant of
a phase shifter that has come
to live in the realm of Avadon.

For its' wisdom it is worshipped
and believed to be capable to
give answers and see the future,
which is probably true.






Temple Guardian

In a forgotten age when
Ossuary was constructed, the
original architects with their
great abilties left behind this
marvelous construct.

The construct, so called the
temple guardian, it's true name
the Bo-Gy-Mon, can be found
inscribed in warnings on
the walls outside. Many are
the number of victims that
have perished to this invisible
phantom since Ossuary was
re-excavated, so many long
years ago.






Ossuary Lion Warrior

In high standing amongst
the Ossuary cultists are these
Lion Warriors, who adorn
themselves in animal furs.
They are often seen at the side
of their large black cats.

There seems to be a certain
affinity for feline worship
amongst these profane desert
cults. Perhaps the fascination
stems from the mythos of the
nine lives.

Most fitting for a cult so invested
in preserving the dead.






Phoenix

The Phoenix is a fully feathered
and fiery magical being which
has chosen to take upon the form
of a magnificent flaming bird.

The Ossuarian cultists believe
that the manifestation of such
being, capable of dying and being
reborn, can provide secrets
from beyond the veil of death.

However, to my eyes which have
seen many a thing, the phoenix
bear more of a mark of a sorcerer's
spell and illusions than any
godly powers from beyond.






Skeletal Dragon

Deep in Ossuary in a small crack
between the sandstone walls
you can find the passage to
the large caverns where the
Skeletal Dragons reside.

Despite their former existence
as proud Dragons, they care now
of little other than that bestowed
upon them through ordinary
Undead traits, such as the affinity
for hoarding shiny treasures.

They serve a powerful master who
can be heard speak with the dead
in the forlorn tombs beyond.






Speaker of the Dead

Riding upon an undead steed,
the Speaker of the Dead is
one of the high priests of the
Ossuarian cult, and the only
one who is allowed entry into
the ancient tomb of the king.

I saw him at a distance as the
cultists carried mummified
bodies from the dragon caverns
and towards the tomb. The Speaker
then alone dragged each corpse
beyond into the darkness, and
with his eyes always closed he
emerged, each time looking sicker
and more like a corpse himself.






The Forgotten King

Like the shifting sands of the
desert, the passage of time slowly
plucked away from existence
the wizened old warlocks who
could remember when 'It' was
sealed inside the tomb. Not
long after that, the hot winds also
eroded away and hid the many
written warnings left in the dunes,
and even then there were none
left alive who could read them.
Centuries later, through the
greed of graverobbers, blood
was spilled breaking the seal,
releasing 'It' and the great Curse
locked up within.
