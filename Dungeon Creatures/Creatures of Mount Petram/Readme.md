Devil Bat

The Devil Bat, so called
for its' remarkably ugly
appearance, in particular the
snout, the unevenly set eyes
and most of the rest of the face.

It is a festering parasite
upon magical trees, living
off the sorcerous sap that
many of those gnarled old
willows produce.

Despite its' fearsome visage
it is naught more work
to dispose of than to swat
a few flies on a summer day.






Aged Earth

When the great mountain of
Petram erupted from the lava
mantle and quickly cooled to its'
coarse rock formations, some
of the more finely ground rocks
and shards did not quite find
the time right for idle rest, but
instead preferred to wander the
halls as restless clumps of densely
packed clay and earth.

Unabated the magic that came
from the depths of Avadon
remind us that we know far
less than we often would wish.






Trapdoor Spider

Caught in it's webs, an unfortunate
event, but with great scientific
potential, I witnessed the work
of these arachnids, I wish
only my observations were
more accurate were it not
for the thick layer of webs that
covered my eyes and crushed
my ribcage, with only a gulp
of room left to draw an earthy
breath of cavernous air.

Disinterested in me, I was
easily rescued, and leaving we
could sense the hidden spiders
but saw nothing at all.







Broken Idol

The constructed machinations
with their whizzing gears under
an almost life-like outer cover
are a curiosity that can only
be explained as the creation
of a brilliant but crazed mind.

Finely crafted, clearly with
elaborate effort, these so
called idols outlasted the
defunct door now open to all
which they diligently guard,
the fuel within them on a slow
burn only used for slight
movement and to feebly
stun the unattentive explorer.






Minotaur Berserker

In the labyrinthine depths
hidden in the wealth of small
passages and secret corridors
one will find the Minotaurs who
will strike a bone chilling fear
into those who hear their
hooves creeping up in the dark.

Their short-haired skin covered
with ancient symbols and in the
back of their heavy skulls, a
small hole reminiscent of a wound
from the parasitic brain slugs,
perhaps these creatures are in
servitude to the more primordial
forces of the mountain.






Lichenid

The botanical gardens of
Mount Petram are indeed
a sight to behold, lest you not
risk to look too long.

The Lichenid gardeners
have a certain kind of
malicious green fingers that
have a strong affinity to grow
the most vile and repulsive
noxious plant life and certainly
nothing that would take more
than a moment to snuff out
a life with either poison,
incendiary chemicals or sharp
gelatinous fangs.






Noxweed

A curious plant, quick to move
when it so desires, and disguised
as a harmless flower for picking.
The only thing it lets come near
are the small rock flies that
otherwise bother explorers
by burrowing under their skin.

Perhaps my imagination or
my keen and experienced eyes
but they appear to speak to
one another and I could swear
I saw one reading a book before
a billowing cloud of poison
followed me as I ran fast away,
the rock flies buzzing around me.






Deathstalk

The Deathstalks, so known for
their disgintuishing features
of death and many long stalks.
Thus appropriately named,
however it is harder to believe
that such beings are indeed
plants and not some animal.

Nothing in the depths is larger
than that it would fit into the jaws
of the Deathstalk, and as it mostly
lives off worms and rock flies I
conclude that the depletion of
appropriately sized prey has
stunted it's growth. A fully
developed one I rather not see.






Fungaloid

Just as other humanoid
manifestations, the story of the
mushroom men of the mountain
has always been intriguing.

These agents of the mycelium
which permeates the earthen layer
are the natural next step for an
otherwise immobile and ancient
fungus species. You will
find them short tempered and
as a general rule no great
conversationalists, however
if you do not mind you will
find them exquisite when fried
in butter with a pinch of pepper.






Moss Giant

With no great surprise but with
utmost fascination I recorded the
presence of these tremendous
tree creatures, covered with
a thick layer of impervious bark.

In no need of sinking roots
into the ground for its' sustenance,
these giants are free to wander
the peculiar grassy knolls of the
caverns, stopping on occasion
to dip their arms in the still water
so that their vascular tissue may
draw materials and moisture
into their hulking mass.






Dusk Dragon

The reptiles which are trapped
within the labyrinths of the
mountain bear no sign of the
otherwise so strong will that
leave one awestruck in the
presence of Dragons.

Instead they carry a strong
resemblance to the proud Smoke
Dragons, only robbed of their
aspect for so long, they have
become bleached and covered in
grime. Knowing to look, I saw
the small hole in their skulls,
and knew then they are mindless
or at least not of their own mind.






Diamond Elemental

The gemstone beings of mountain
are each one more brilliant than
the other, and the diamond
elemental is by far the most
magnificent. With natural
skepticism of a geologist, I find
it unlikely that a flawless diamond
of that caliber was derived
from the otherwise abundant
melt and volatile magma of the
mountain. Such is my suspicion
that the gemstone beings are
related to the guardian constructs,
although no gears or circuits,
or any way for an operator
to enter this armor is visible.






Fen Daemon

In the swindling depths a stone
circle can be found, lit up by so
many braziers. A magical anvil
of sorts at which the blood of
amibitous cultists are able
to conjure a daemonic presence

This lurid green visitor is a
feigned attempt to seem
natural, the mark of deceit
so known to daemons is
quickly noticed by those not
ensnared by its' promises, and
the thankless cultists would
soon find themselves to be
slaves and masters of none.






Lodestone

The gentle giant of Mount
Petram had been well asleep
for who knows how long, until
the human explorers, curious
as ever, started chipping away
at its skin, harder than diamond.
Little did they know, that they
were in fact clipping the toe nails
of this gargantuan elemental, who
blended in so well in the rest of
the cavern walls, complete with
stalagmites and overgrown moss.
When Lodestone finally woke up,
they say the earthquake made
glassware fly off the shelves as far
away as Corpse Creek.






Terathan Goliath

Many years ago an excentric
explorer had taken a little pet
terathan creature from the jungle
islands with him on the many
expeditions to Mount Petram.
Quite fond of the small creature,
he let it roam free to hunt bugs.
Forgetting about the brain slugs,
he watched, powerless and in
horror as one infested his pet
which quickly skittered off on
eight uncoordinated legs into
the darkness, never seen again
until years later when it was
discovered living in a cavern
and grown to a goliath size.
