Embear

The family of Ursidae are
indeed vast, from polar bears to
these more fiery beasts. The
Embears are known to many
animal tamers to have a strong
liking to blueberries and
acorns, likely a primal urge
not yet erased the time
which has passed since
these bears decided to
venture down into the depths
of the Inferno. Which was
a long time ago, evidenced by
the older embears sometimes
found encased and hibernating
within old geodes of rock.






Searing Imp

The mischievous nature of these
relatives of gremlins and kobolds
is quickly noted by the unattentive
as they feel the singe of hot
embers thrown down their pants.

The cackling imps like to whizz
around in open spaces and make
foul comments in their otherwise
unintelligible tounge, the only
entertaining trick they seem to
be capable of being taught,
unless you also also count their
prowess at settings things on fire






Infernal Soldier

A foot soldier of the infernal
army, said to be paid in
embers and hot rocks, but
more likely a disembodied
phantasm of fire magic, with
no interest in possessions or
other worldly things.

Well supplied by the infernal
forges in the depths, their
incandescent blades never
cool as to always be ready to
cut through metal or flesh,
or whichever their master wills
them to strike upon.







Molten Hellion

A daemonical creature loosely
held together by a smidgeon
of dark magics and mostly
consisting of semi-solid minerals,
some of which will roll of it's back
and set fires while it burns out.

This explains the behaviour
observed that the Hellions will
gnaw and chew at the rock faces
to replenish the molten stone
falling off which would otherwise
make them miniscule and soon
to disappear. In doing so the
Infernal depths grow ever larger.






Living Fire

The heat of these elemental
beings will strike you like
a hammer and as you are
instantly driven to exhaustion
with the sweat pearling on your
brow, you may at least
be entertained by the dancing
and marvelous flames
of mostly yellow but also
many other colours, just shortly
before you are burned to a crisp.

So sayeth at least the companions
of the scholarly Sir. Barb E' Que,
who saw it at first hand when
the knight tried to play with fire.






Bullvore

A well travelled explorer who
meets the capricious Bullvore
for the first time will be sure
to notice a delectable odour
seeming completely out of
place. This is the unmistakable
scent of the Bullvore droppings,
used across Avadon in the
parfume of many fine ladies
both in courts and less honourable
establishments.

However, a mere peasant would
only pinch his nose and think
nothing of it, simple minded as
he would be.






Hellhound

This eldritch horror and gatekeeper
of the inferno in many a mythos
is a hound only for the lack of
a better descriptor. Its'
massive jaws dangle with shreds
of skin that seem to crack
from the hulking beast that lives
within, and sharp bones jut out
of its' back ready to impale anyone
who dares step close.

The hellhounds are often
accompanied by a beastmaster
from the infernal army, required
to keep these daemons in check
as to not run entirely wild.






Volcanite

One of the few natural creatures
that inhabit the Inferno, this
otherwise kind spirited creature
has been tainted by the
otherwise so incendiary mood
will cling to all and any who
delves into the depths.

The Volcanite, a tiny creature
housed within a shell of obsidian
tinted with yellow minerals, which
it will periodically shed, keeps
mostly to itself. But what small
home it has made, it will
guard with a fierce fervor.






Infernal Knight

This untouchable warrior
commands a mighty presence
where he slowly wanders around
carried by an equally fearsome
steed made from pure flame.

The knights of Inferno serve
their master the great Lord
Infernus, who is said to have
delved into the center of the
earth and stolen the heart of
the mountain, one of his
many ancient sources of power.
A small piece of the magic, but
oh so deadly, imbued into his
most loyal minions.






Lava Elemental

Born from fluctuations in the
lava below, like many other
natural elementals, this glowing
orange being is an embodiment
of the conditions which sparked
it into existence.

This particular elemental found
in the conflux of the newly
formed rock and the flowing lava,
will true to it's nature seek to
burn and smelt anything in
it's presence, uncontrollable
as all forces of the nature are.






Infernal Giant

A horned and beastly daemon
and one of the lord Infernus
most trusted servants, in his
service by their own free will
and paid nothing more than the
amusement they are get from
being the strong handed
overseers of the infernal army.

They also serve as the keepers
of the portals between us
and the Inferno, and are able
to open small cracks in the fabric
of reality to let the destruction of
the Infernal realm rain into
our bleak reality.






Molten Daemon

A sight to behold, were it not
for the danger of such curiosity.
These daemonic beings of molten
rocks, held together by their
infernal will, dwarfs all others.

Such is the depravity of
their souls that the light around
them seems to fade and the
darkness would only be set alight
when the Daemon draws breath
and his skin is briefly pierced by
uncountable flames, much like
the ones that curl around its'
greatsword and long and
winding barbed whip.






Infernal Chosen

The elite soldiers of the
Infernal army, often called
the Chosen ones, have been
the inspiration for many stories
of disciplined and unyielding
warriors, virtuous were it not
for their dark origins.

With my own eyes I saw them
as one removed his helmet, to
reveal nothing but empty space
or perhaps there was a small
glowing spark in it's place. It left
me puzzled and wondering the
price that one would pay
to wield such formidable skills.






Heart of the Mountain

A rhythmic thud echoes
through the sulphurous air
of the Inferno. The emanating
power weakens the resolve
of those who do not belong
there, and greatly enhances the
powers of those who serve the
Master. The same thud
called upon Lord Infernus as
he delved into the endless fathoms
of molten magma and reached
the core of Avadon, where
he stole the heart of the world,
to bend its powers to his own
nefarious will.









Infernus

The Lord Infernus inhabited
drawn to the power of something
that once lay upon the ocean floor.
What this relic was, none can say.

The Daemon now rules like a king
in the realm that he has founded
for himself. In his servitude he
has many daemonic beings as
well as his enslaved and fearsome
Infernal Army. Should the
attention of the Lord of Inferno
ever be directed outwards to the
realm above, that would surely
be the beginning of the
Apocalypse and end of times.
