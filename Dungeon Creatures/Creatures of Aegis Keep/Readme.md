**Gremlins**

Diminutive and feeble,
Gremlins typically resort to
trickery when forced into direct
confrontation with a combatant
much larger than themselves.

Given their stature, this almost
always seems to be the case.

A typical Gremlin tactic is to
use smoke bombs to distract
their opponent. Or, in the case
of a conflict between fellow
Gremlins, a poorly-stored cheese
offered at a social gathering
often sends the desired message.

**Goblins**

Slightly larger than their
Gremlin relatives, Goblins
are much more prone to incite
physical violence to resolve any
slights, perceived or otherwise.

Skilled with throwing knives,
Goblins make excellent
skirmishers in any army
willing to tolerate their
animosity, dull-wittedness, and
infamously poor personal
hygiene.


---



**Kobolds**

The most intelligent of the
Goblinoid family, Kobolds
are keen engineers and often
found working alongside Orcs
and other demi-humans bereft
of technical ability.

Kobolds are also consummate
alchemists, and often create
fire bombs from a mixture of
fire dust, wood shavings, Orc
dung, and several even less
savory ingredients.




---


**Wolfhounds**

The result of a long process of
selective breeding, Wolfhounds
possess the intelligence of a
domesticated canine, but still
display the unbridled ferocity
of the feral wolf from which it
derives its namesake.

Popular as war animals among
demi-humans such as Orcs and
Ogres, Wolfhounds reach their
true potential for violence in the
employ of other beings willing
to embrace their savage nature.

**Claymen**

Little is known of Claymen,
however many popular theories
exist on the subject.

More than one noteworthy mage
has claimed that they are
elemental entities, manifesting
when earth is moved without
given permission by the spirits.

Another more popular theory,
is that the Clayman is the result
a wicked individual meeting
their demise in quicksand, and
returning to continue to bestow
misery and foulness in mud form.

**Coagulator**

Less a creature than a
haphazardly combined pile of
vital organs, the Coagulator
exhibits an incredible ability
to repair itself, regenerating
tissue at a feverish rate.

Many an adventurer have been
driven to despair, thinking
themselves having slain the
creature, only to discover its
killing blow merely a temporary
inconvenience for the wretched
thing.



---


**Chaos Footman**

It is popular belief that in
places of strife, suffering, and
lawlessness, chaos itself may
sometimes manifest and take
human form.

Whether or not this is true,
what is known is that these
Chaos Footmen as they are called
are formidable warriors and
capable of great violence against
anyone foolish enough to stumble
upon them.

Swinging wildly, they strike at
anything within inhuman reach.



---


**Chaos Warriors**

When armies clash, chaos
and terror follows in its wake.
The greater the conflict, the
more powerful the despair and
raw chaos that is born from it.

When bitterness and enmity
sinks its roots deep, powerful
forces manifest and feed upon
that hatred.

Chaos Warriors are beings of
living malice, both powerful and
skilled at dispensing terrific
violence to any being it lays
sight upon.


---



**Chaos Knights**

When all thought of peace and
conciliation between men has
vanished, and only raw, true
hatred remains, only then can
pure chaos take form.

Chaos Knights exist only to
bring ruin and death, and are
without peer in that pursuit.

The weaponry and armaments
of the most brutal and
bloodthirsty men indescribably
seem to gravitate to these
creatures, as if their eagerness
for death takes a life of its own.


---



**Doppelganger**

Equal parts mischief and
malevolence, the Doppelganger
is not a being of this world.

As such, they view existence
through a much different lens
than that of mortals, and are
prone to curiosity-driven
interactions with an often less
than receptive being.

Possessing the uncanny ability
to mimic both the sound and
appearance of individuals, they
can pose both a terrifying threat
or a delightful diversion.



---


**Garou**

One could fill entire volumes on
the robust culture and history of
Werefolk' as they are popularly
known.

What is not known, however, is
origin of arcane power exhibited
by some among them, known
commonly as Garou.

Garou seem to fill both a
magisterial role in 'Were'
society and have a rich pantheon
of rites, rituals, and civil laws
they administer among 'Were'
society.


---



**Aegis Nobles**

Life eternal. Considered by
many the greatest gift one could
ever hope to receive.

And yet the nobility did not
rejoice when they obtained it.
For one of the costs to be paid
by the dire curse was cruel
indeed: they were bound within
the walls of the keep for all
eternity.




---

**Aegis Cultists**

It is not known whether the
Cult of Aegis preceded the great
curse that befell the keep, or
even whether they played a role
in its genesis.

What is known, is that the
hauntingly stoic members of the
cult now act as custodians and
stewards of the keep, and attend
to organizing its defense should
any trespassers set foot within
its walls.

Fervent and unrelenting, they
live only to serve the keep.


---



**Sanguineous**

Among the fiercest of the
knights of Aegis Keep, none
were greater than Sir Guinous.

Such was his lust for battle
and his zeal to fulfill his bloody
task, that when the grim curse
befell the men of Aegis, he became
something entirely different.

Primal, blood-frenzied, and
wholly monstrous, he thinks
nothing but sating an insatiable
thirst for blood and carnage.
As so Sir Guinous became ever
known as Sanguineous.

**Aegis High Priestess**

She came to the keep in the guise
of a simple priestess, and
proffered to the lords an
irresistible proposal.

Spill the blood of one maiden
and I shall bestow long life.
Spill the blood of several
maidens, and I shall grant thee
power beyond compare.

Greed thorned its way into the
hearts of the men of Aegis Keep
upon hearing the offer. And so
they slew every maiden in
Horseshoe Bay.
